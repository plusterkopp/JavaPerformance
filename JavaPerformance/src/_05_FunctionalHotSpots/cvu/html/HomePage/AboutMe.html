<td WIDTH="68%">I work as an independent freelance trainer, and develop
and conduct courses in Europe and the USA. I am co-author of the authoritative
book on "C++ Standard IOStreams and Locales" published at Addison Wesley.
I wrote the column "Effective Standard Library" for the US magazines C++
Report and C/C++ Users Journal. Currently I write a column named "Effective
Java" for the German magazine Java Spektrum. In addition, I wrote countless
book reviews for Fawcette Technical Publications online magazine DevX,
and I enjoy speaking at conferences all over the world. I am an obeserving
member of the ISO/ANSI C++ standards committee.&nbsp;
<p>Currently my preferred fields of interest are training, coaching, and
mentoring in the area of object-oriented software development in C++ and
Java. I am most interested in development of explanatory material, including
course material, multimedia training, books, and articles and I enjoy passing
on my expertise in&nbsp; lectures, seminars, and workshops.&nbsp;
<p>My area of expertise is advanced C++ and Java programming, concurrent
programming, Enterprise Java, and many more. For further information go
