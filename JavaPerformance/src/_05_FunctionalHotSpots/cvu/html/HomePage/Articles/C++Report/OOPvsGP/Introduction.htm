<p>As an attentive reader of C++ Report it will not have escaped your attention
that during the past months there have been three articles explaining the
structures and techniques related to iterators in the Standard C++ Library.
Well, those were feature articles preceding a regular column on the Standard
C++ Library.
<p>We have not yet had the opportunity to introduce you to the why-and-what
of this column. Let's make up for this omission now. First of all - its
name. We suggested to call the column "Effective Standard C++ Library"
in hommage &agrave; Scott Meyers and his "Effective C++" books, which we
do like quite a bit. Secondly, before we start to explain the intention
of the column, let us have a short look at what we mean by Standard C++
Library. The diagram below is meant to be sort of a road map. It gives
you an overview of the content and structure of the Standard C++ Library.
It will reappear in future columns to help you keeping track of where we
are, i.e. we want to prevent you from losing orientation in the library
jungle.
<p>So, here is what the Standard C++ Library comprises:

<p><b>Data Structures and Algorithms </b>are based on a proposal made by
Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee of Hewlett-Packard. The proposal was submitted
to the ISO/ANSI committee and accepted as part of the standard in 1994.
Early versions of it were made publicly available as the STL, the Standard
Template Library. Standardization proceeded; many refinements were suggested
and voted in. Today we have two diverging libraries: we have the standardized
data structures and algorithms in the Standard C++ Library in parallel
to the old, original STL that is available as public domain software. Both
libraries comprise various containers like vector, list, map, and set,
quite a number of algorithms, and the iterators, which we discussed at
length in the preceding three articles. The design of these libraries is
a demonstration of generic programming, a novel programming paradigm that
separates data structures from algorithms. Function objects are another
category of components in the Standard C++ Library; they are used as parameters
to data structures and operations and are a powerful means in generic programming.
Allocators were added later on, in order to make the data structures more
flexible and adaptable to different memory allocation schemes. We will
tell you more about them in the future.
<p><b>Internationalization</b> is supported by the Standard C++ Library
by means of the locale class and its facets. This component was designed
and suggested by Nathan Myers in 1994. Major design issues were discussed
and resolved until 1996. Traditionally, internationalization support was
offered by the standard C library. However, the C library is of somewhat
limited use, because its locale is a global one, which introduces problems
in multilingual environments where multiple locales are needed. The locale
framework introduces the notion of <i>facets</i>. A facet maintains a certain
set of internationalization services, e.g. numeric facets hold information
about the representation of the decimal point, the thousand separator,
etc., and knows how to parse and format numbers. The <i>locale</i> <i>framework</i>
serves as a container of facets. The framework can be extended; new user
defined facet types can be created and new facets objects can be added
to a locale object.
<p><b>Streams Input and Output</b> is the next generation of IOStreams.
Since the old days of C++, compilers have come with an IOStreams library.
Cfront, which was one of the first C++ compilers, was delivered with an
IOStreams library that was designed by Jerry Schwarz at AT&amp;T. Other
compiler vendors recognized this IOStreams library as a kind of de-facto
standard and offered IOStreams libraries with similar interfaces and behavior.
Naturally, Jerry Schwarz was one of the people who contributed substantially
to the new IOStreams component for the Standard C++ Library. The new standard
IOStreams is a templatized and internationalized component for text and
binary input and output. It aimed for staying compliant with the notion
and design of the traditional IOStreams. However, fundamental changes were
introduced over the time. The most significant was the decision to templatize
the IOStreams classes on the character type. The intent was to extend the
IOStreams framework so that it does not only work with one-byte-character
streams, but also with wide character streams. Another logical consequence
was to equip streams with a locale object in order to enable streams to
adjust their behavior to local conventions such a numeric formatting rules
or character conversion necessities.
<p><b>Miscellaneous</b> comprises everything else. There is a string class.
There is a hierarchy of exception classes, some of which are thrown by
the runtime system of the language itself; the operator <i>new()</i> for
instance throws a <tt><font face="Courier New">bad_alloc</font></tt> exception
if it cannot make any memory available. Other standard exceptions are thrown
by library components, such as out_of_<tt><font face="Courier New">range</font></tt>,
which is raised by the string class's operator[]() for instance in case
the index is greater than the string's size. The hierarchy itself already
suggests how the exception should be handled and thus can serve as a base
for your own exception classes. For example there is a distinction between
run time errors and logical errors. Logical errors are bugs in your program's
logic. Runtime errors cannot be anticipated, such as memory shortage for
instance.
<p>Another set of classes is for numeric problems; there is a complex number
class template and a numeric array. The numeric array uses sophisticated
template idioms, so-called expression templates, in order to serve as a
high-performance building block for matrices and multidimensional arrays.
<h3>
What will the column be about?</h3>
There is already a lot of printed material available that describes the
functionality of the Standard C++ Library and the STL. For example the
following books: <a href="#1">[i]</a>,<a href="#2">[ii]</a>,<a href="#3">[iii]</a>,
<a href="#4">[iv]</a>,
or <a href="#5">[v]</a>. The majority of those books are about the STL.
<a href="#1">[i]</a>,<a href="#2">[ii]</a>,
and <a href="#3">[iii]</a> come close to a user's guide and a reference
manual to the STL; they show you the public interface of, say, the <i>vector&lt;></i>
class template, or how to apply a <i>merge</i> algorithm. <a href="#4">[iv]</a>
goes beyond this descriptive approach and demonstrates how one can build
more complex data structures on top of the STL containers. <a href="#5">[v]</a>
covers the entire Standard C++ Library. The focus still is on data structures
and algorithms; stream input/output and internationalization are only described
in brevity.
<p>The intention of our column, however, is different. It will not be about
the plain usage of the library's components, but will focus on explaining
the idioms that are used in the design of the library. Take for example
the traits technique that we described in one of our former articles <a href="#6">[vi]</a>.
This is an idiom used in the Standard C++ Library, which can be applied
whenever types should be associated to a class <i>and</i> built-in types.
Such an idiom is used in the Standard C++ Library on the one hand, but
is also helpful to any<i> </i>C++ designer.
<p>Besides the explanation of idioms from the library we also want to show
concrete tricks and techniques that are needed to effectively use and extend
the Standard C++ Library framework. Our latest article <a href="#7">[vii]</a>,
where we built a <i>safe iterator, </i>is a general assembly plan for an
iterator that complies to the standard library framework. It explained
how to extend the Standard C++ Library in adding a new iterator type.

<font size=+2>Generic Programming and Its Impact on Software Design</font></h3>

<table BORDER=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>However, before we will delve into the details of Standard C++ Library
in future contributions to this column, let us first spend a couple of
thoughts on how the philosophy and design of the library will influence
the way we design and develop our applications. This time the considerations
will focus on <i>application software</i> <i>design</i> rather than implementation
techniques used in the Standard C++ Library. Let's restrict the discussion
on the most popular part of the library, the data structures and algorithms
from the Standard C++ Library and, in analogy, the STL.&nbsp;</td>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Aspects of Generic Programming</font></font>
<p>The data structures and algorithms in the Standard C++ Library, and
the STL, are a demonstration of a programming paradigm called <i>generic
programming</i>. The key abstractions of the generic components in the
Standard C++ Library are <i>containers</i>, <i>algorithms</i>, and <i>iterators</i>.
Containers hold the data. Containers also export pointer-like objects,
so-called iterators, that give access to the data elements held in a container.
Algorithms do the work. They accept iterators and iterator ranges as arguments
and use them to access a container and perform certain operations on the
container. In principle there is a clear separation between data and operations
on the data; the glue between both elements are the iterators.
<p><img SRC="IMG00003.gif" height=32 width=339>
<p>Here's an example, a find algorithm applied to a list container:
<pre>list&lt;string> Friends; // <b>container

</b>// populate the list

list&lt;string>::iterator begin = Friends.begin() // <b>iterator</b> to the begin of the container
list&lt;string>::iterator end = Friends.begin()&nbsp;&nbsp; // <b>iterator</b> to the end of the container

// <b>algorithm</b> find() search for "Philippe" in the container
if (find(Friends.begin(),Friends.end(),"Philippe") != Friends.end())
cout &lt;&lt; "Philippe is a friend of mine" &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
There are two types of genericity here.
<ul>
<li>
First, there is the separation of data structures and algorithms. An algorithm
like <tt><font face="Courier New">find()</font></tt> for instance is called
a <i>generic</i> algorithm because you can apply it to any kind of container
that fits into the Standard C++ Library or STL framework. Decoupling of
containers and algorithms via iterators facilitates the generic behavior
of the elements from the Standard C++ Library.</li>

<li>
Secondly, generic components are implemented by using C++ templates. The
<tt><font face="Courier New">find()</font></tt>
algorithm for instance is a function <i>template</i>; one of its template
parameters is the iterator type. The <tt><font face="Courier New">list</font></tt>
container is a class <i>template</i>; one of its template parameters is
the type of elements it holds. Most iterators are class <i>templates</i>
too; they take the value type as one of their template arguments.</li>
</ul>
In sum, we achieve genericity by means of a design idea, i.e. separation
of data structures from algorithms, and by use of programming techniques
supported by the programming language, i.e. C++ class and function templates.
<p>Although generic programming uses classical object-oriented C++ language
features such as class (template) declarations, it is not object-oriented.
How does generic programming contrast to object-oriented ideas?
<p>In object-oriented programs abstractions are expressed by means of base
classes.
<p>In generic programs the abstractions are described in terms of formal,
yet verbal requirements. Examples of such requirements are:
<ul>
<li>
A container must provide certain iterators.</li>

<li>
An iterator must provide certain operations, such as increment and dereference.</li>

<li>
An algorithm must work on iterator ranges.</li>
</ul>
Most of these requirements are expressed in C++ by implicit requirements
to the template arguments of a generic component. A call to <tt><font face="Courier New">find()</font></tt>
for instance will not compile if you provide it with iterators that do
not have an increment operation:
<pre>template &lt;class Iterator, class T>
Iterator find(Iterator first, Iterator last, const T&amp; value)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp; while (first != last &amp;&amp; *first != value)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first++; <i>// Iterator::operator++() used !
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; return first;
}</pre>
We note that a significant part of the generic programming paradigm can
be expressed in terms of C++ language constructs; other parts cannot be
expressed by means of the programming language. There are requirements
to containers, iterators, and algorithms that are <i>not</i> expressed
by means of language features and hence will not even be detected at compile
or template instantiation time. An example is the requirement that a pair
of iterators is supposed to describe a contiguous range of elements, i.e.
the second iterator must be reachable by incrementing the first iterator.
Violations of this requirement are not detected until runtime.
<p>Although both paradigms, object-oriented programming and generic programming,
can be expressed in C++ they are fundamentally different. What does this
difference mean for the design of applications that use generic components?
<h3>
Design Elements of Object-Oriented Software</h3>
It is common wisdom that you do some design before you start coding whenever
you develop software for a system that has a certain degree of complexity.
Depending on various factors, such as your budget, the formal requirements
for your project, the amount of people that have to understand the design,
you can either scribble some notes on a piece of paper, or use a formal
design method instead. In a project where numerous people have to understand
each other's design, it is good practice to use one of the <i>popular </i>formal
object-oriented design methods: Booch Method, Fusion, OMT, ...
<p>What aspects of your software design do you usually model in a object-oriented
design language? Typical elements are:
<ul>
<li>
<i>A static class model.</i> It shows the classes, their interfaces, and
their relationships (inheritance, containment, associations,...), other
details such as the protected and public interface, cardinalities of containment
relationships, roles of associations, and so on.</li>

<li>
<i>A dynamic model.</i> It shows the interaction of objects in representative
scenarios, i.e. it shows typical sequences of calls to (public) member
functions.</li>

<li>
<i>A state diagram</i>, if needed. It shows the potential states of a class
and the state transitions triggered by events.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Software Design and Generic Programming</h3>
What do I have do design in a generic program in contrast to an object-oriented
program? Can I use object-oriented design methods for modeling a generic
program? Well, not really ....
<ul>
<li>
First, not all elements of your generic program are classes. Algorithms
for instance play an important role in generic programming, and they are
function templates, not classes. If you want to reflect the existence of
algorithms, you can be happy if your design method allows free code, as
the Booch method does. In some design methods you will not even be able
to express function templates in an appropriate way.</li>

<li>
Secondly, classes in generic programming are mostly unrelated. There is
no inheritance among containers, iterators, or algorithms. There are only
few containment relationships among containers, iterators, and algorithms.
It's true, containers have an allocator , and associative containers have
a comparitor. However, the main classes do not contain each other</li>

<li>
Also, class interfaces do not reflect all operations of a generic component.
Take the interface of a vector for instance; you will notice that a vector
provides iterators. But it is not obvious that you are allowed to use these
iterators in a call to a <i>sort</i>-algorithm. Still, it is a property
of a vector that it can be sorted via the sort-algorithm. More generally,
you cannot see which operations (or algorithms) are applicable to a certain
container. In an object-oriented program the sort-algorithm would most
likely be a member function of the vector class. Hence the relationship
between the container and the algorithm would be visible and could be expressed
by means of an object-oriented design method. Since in generic programming
many relationships are expressed in terms of implicit requirements to template
arguments there is no way of modeling the relationships between elements
in a generic program by means of an object-oriented design method.</li>
</ul>
In sum, object-oriented design is not ideal for generic programming. This
does not really come as a surprise because object-oriented design methods
essentially capture the semantics of object-oriented programming; that's
what they are for.
<h3>
Using Generic Programming for Application Development</h3>
Does that mean we have to wait until someone some day will invent a "generic
programming design method", before we will be able to use the Standard
C++ Library or the STL in a project that has a complexity which requires
design? To answer this question let's have a broader look at the way we
can use generic programming and generic components in a C++ project. We
can conceive of the following scenarios:
<p><b><u>Scenario 1</u>: Design your application as a generic program.</b>
<p>You would apply the generic programming paradigm to your entire application,
i.e. you would design your application as a generic program that consists
of various generic components that can be plugged together.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><img SRC="IMG00004.gif" height=199 width=232></td>

<td>The C++ standard already defines a set of generic components - the
data structures and algorithms from the Standard C++ Library. It would
certainly be wise to make your abstractions compatible to the standard
framework. Now, think of the main elements of generic programming in the
Standard C++ Library - containers, algorithms, iterators. Adopting the
generic programming paradigm from the Standard C++ Library for an entire
application basically means that you have to categorize all significant
elements of your software to be either an algorithm, or an iterator, or
a container. Is it conceivable to design an entire application in terms
of just 3 different abstractions?&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It is not as restrictive as is sounds. The notion of these main elements
can be broadened to some extent. Take the abstraction of a container for
instance. A container in essence is an object that can provide iterators
to let algorithms operate on itself. Hence, a container need not necessarily
be a typical 'container' data structure such as a list or a queue. Generic
algorithms can be applied to the <tt><font face="Courier New">istream</font></tt>
from the Standard IOStreams via <tt><font face="Courier New">istream_iterator</font></tt>'s,
too.
<p>Also, the generic programming paradigm does not impose any limitations
regarding the type or number of abstractions. You are free to invent novel
generic abstractions. Allocators are an example of this; they were introduced
to the STL in the process of making the STL part of the Standard C++ Library.
Allocators added another dimension of genericity to containers, see [].
You can also contrive a novel set of requirements to algorithms; you might
want to add algorithms that accept containers as arguments rather than
iterator ranges. Examples for that can be found in Graham Glass's column
"STL in Action".
<p>In principle, it is conceivable that you use the ideas of generic programming
in your application design, broaden the standard abstractions and add new
generic elements. Still, can you imagine that <i>all</i> elements of your
software can be squeezed into the pattern of either algorithms, or iterators,
or containers, and a few other generic elements? We think that this will
be very rarely true. In some cases it <i>is</i> true, in particular for
foundation libraries that provide data structures and algorithms. In those
cases, where the generic programming paradigm fits, your design is more
or less done, because you already know how all elements of your design
can be classified into certain generic abstractions and how they will collaborate.
You would not need to do any elaborated design anymore; you would just
stick to a well-defined classification of generic components.
<p><b><u>Scenario 2</u>: Design your application as an object-oriented
program that uses the generic components</b>.
<p>In this case you will apply classical object-oriented design techniques,
and then build this object-oriented application on top of the generic components
from the Standard C++ Library or the STL. In principle there are two possibilities
for doing this:
<ol>
<li>
You can either use the generic components directly, or</li>

<li>
you introduce a middle layer of object-oriented base components that are
built on top of the generic components from the Standard C++ Library or
the STL.</li>
</ol>

<table BORDER=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><img SRC="IMG00005.gif" height=222 width=254></td>

<td>If you use the generic components directly, i.e. without a middle layer,
these generic components will show up in your object-oriented design model.
One reasonable way of integrating them is to model the standard containers
as classes, and all standard algorithms that can be applied to a container
as methods of the respective container class. (This is different from the
generic approach where containers and algorithms are more decoupled.) Basically
you would fake an object-oriented container model.&nbsp;
<p>In your object-oriented design the application domain objects will have
use- and containment-relationships to the faked object-oriented container
classes.&nbsp;
<p>However, for purpose of implementation, your application domain classes
you will ultimately have to use the generic components as they are: as
containers with separate algorithms.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><img SRC="IMG00006.gif" height=221 width=247></td>

<td>An alternative possibility is to really implement the object-oriented
containers from our design model above, i.e. you will implement a middle
layer on top of the generic components.&nbsp;
<p>In your object-oriented design the application domain objects will have
use- and containment-relationships to the object-oriented container classes
from the middle layer.&nbsp;
<p>Different from the approach suggested above, you will also use these
object-oriented containers in your implementation. You will not have to
switch back to generic programming then.&nbsp;
<p>The generic components from the Standard C++ Library will be hidden
behind an object-oriented wrapper and will serve solely as a portability
layer. They will be invisible both in design and implementation.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>
<font size=+2>Conclusion</font></h3>
There is a mismatch between object-oriented design / object-oriented programming
on the one hand and generic programming / use of generic components on
the other hand. You cannot appropriately express generic programming in
a an object-oriented design. Either you refrain from doing object-oriented
design (scenario 1) and stick to the generic programming paradigm. Or you
do object-oriented design, fake an object-oriented container model for
that purpose, and accept that your implementation does not exactly match
the design (scenario 2a). Or you hide the generic components under an object-oriented
layer that you can include both in your design and implementation (scenario
2b). All three alternatives are viable approaches. However, generic programming
seems to be suitable for a smaller number of application domains compared
to object-oriented programming, which is a true general purpose programming
paradigm that fits many needs. For this reason we doubt that basing larger
projects solely on generic programming is reasonable. There is evidence
that object-oriented programming helps mastering large projects and there
is no reason for throwing over board this realization. In any case, C++
is a multi-paradigm programming language and techniques and components
from its Standard Library are useful in many cases. We will continue exploring
them in further columns.

<tr>
<td><b><font size=+1>Stereotypes - A Mechanism for Metaclassification</font></b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>The Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is currently under definition
at Rational Software, introduces a concept called <i>stereotypes</i> in
its latest version, which is UML V0.91 (see <a href="#9">[ix]</a> for reference).
Stereotypes address the problem of metaclassification of an element in
UML. An example of an element that needs metaclassification is an exception
class; it has the special property that it should generally only be thrown
or caught, but cannot be used in a different context: No other use of an
exception class is intended. In classifying an exception class as a &laquo;exception&raquo;
stereotype allows to express these special semantics. There are predefined
stereotypes in UML; &laquo;exception&raquo; is one of them. However, UML
allows users to add new kinds of stereotypes along with a specification
of their semantics. Stereotypes are a means that allows end users some
degrees of freedom in tailoring the modeling language to their needs.&nbsp;
<p>We can imagine that stereotypes will help modeling generic components.
For instance, we can conceive of semantic specifications for &laquo;container&raquo;,
&laquo;iterator&raquo;, and &laquo;algorithm&raquo; stereotypes, which
then can be used for modeling the generic data structures and algorithms
from the Standard C++ Library and the STL. That means it looks like UML
can serve as a design language that can handle the mix of object oriented
design and generic programming elements on one hand and, on the other hand,
can be used for a pure generic programming design.&nbsp;
<p>However, this is a look into the crystal ball; stereotypes cannot yet
be considered common practice in software design since Unified Modeling
Language V1.0 is not yet born. Still, stereotypes might become the "generic
programming modeling language" as well as a way to integrate object oriented
design and generic programming.</td>
