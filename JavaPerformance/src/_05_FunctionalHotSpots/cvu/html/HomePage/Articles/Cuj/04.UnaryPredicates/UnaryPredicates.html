<br>&nbsp;
<p>Several algorithms in the standard library use a unary predicate to
accomplish their tasks. Examples are the <b>_if</b><i> </i>algorithms like
<b>count_if</b>,
<b>find_if</b>,
<b>remove_if</b>,
or <b>replace_if</b>, but also algorithms like <b>partition</b>. In this
installment of the column, we take a closer look at unary predicates and
what they may and must not do.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Let us see how the Standard defines a unary predicate. It is simply
called <i>predicate</i> in the Standard <a href="#1">[1]</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><b>UNARY PREDICATE.</b>
<p>The <b>Predicate</b> parameter is used whenever an algorithm expects
a function object that when applied to the result of dereferencing the
corresponding iterator returns a value testable as true. In other words,
if an algorithm takes <b>Predicate pred</b> as its argument and <b>first</b>
as its iterator argument, it should work correctly in the construct <b>(pred(*first)){...}</b>.
<p>The function object <b>pred</b> shall not apply any non-constant function
through the dereferenced iterator.
<p>This function object may be a pointer to function, or an object of a
type with an appropriate function call operator.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
From this specification and the examination of the algorithms that use
unary predicates (which we will look into later in this article), we can
identify a number of properties typical of a unary predicate. We will discuss
each of the properties in detail in this article. A unary predicate's properties
are:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ol><b>Basic Properties</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
A unary predicate must be callable.</li>

<li>
A unary predicate must accept one argument and return a value that is convertible
to Boolean.</li>

<li>
A unary predicate need not be copyable.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Side-Effect Properties</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
A unary predicate must not modify its argument.</li>

<li>
A unary predicate must not invalidate iterators or sequences that the algorithm
works with.</li>

<li>
A unary predicate can have any side effect other than the ones described
in 4 and 5.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Other Properties</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
A unary predicate must be <i>order-insensitive</i>, which means that the
effect of calling the predicate must be independent of the order in which
sequence elements are supplied to it.</li>

<li>
A unary predicate need not yield the same result for different invocations
with the same argument.</li>
</ol>
Let us see why it makes sense that a predicate has exactly these properties.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Basic Properties 1, 2, and 3</h3>
<i>A unary predicate must be callable, but need not necessarily be copyable,
and must accept one argument and return a Boolean value.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>These properties are more or less evident when we consider how the standard
defines use of a unary predicate by an algorithm, namely that the predicate
"should work correctly in the construct<b> if (pred(*first)){...}</b>".
Here is a typical implementation of an algorithm that demonstrates the
intended use of a unary predicate:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>template &lt;class InputIterator, class Predicate>
typename iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator>::difference_type
count_if(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Predicate pred) {
&nbsp; typename iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator>::difference_type n = 0;
&nbsp; for ( ; first != last; ++first)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( <b>pred(*first)</b> )
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ++n;
&nbsp; return n;
}</pre>
In other words, a unary predicate is called like a function. The requirement
of "callable" is met by a pointer to a function, but also by an object
(or a reference to an object) of a type that has the function call operator
defined (a so-called <i>functor</i>). One argument is supplied when the
predicate is called. The argument is the result of dereferencing an iterator,
that is, a reference to a sequence element. The return value is used as
a conditional expression and must be convertible to type <b>bool</b>. And
this fully describes the purpose of a unary predicate: it is called to
produce a Boolean result for elements in a sequence.
<p>In particular, there is no requirement regarding the copy semantics
of a unary predicate. It need not even be copyable at all. As a general
rule, an algorithm must not rely on any properties that are not required
of the objects it uses. This includes that an algorithm must not copy the
predicate, because a user is not required to provide any reasonable copy
semantics for his predicates. It's just fine if we declare copy constructor
and copy assignment as private members of our predicate type and pass around
our predicate objects by reference, if that makes sense to us. It should
not break any algorithm. In practice, you will find libraries that assume
copyability of predicates, although they shouldn't. One of the surprising
effects of such standard library implementations have been discussed in
an article in <i>C++ Report</i> <a href="#2">[2]</a>. Meanwhile some library
implementations have eliminated this restriction and behave as expected;
for instance, see Metrowerks CodeWarrior 6.0. Taking into account the different
library implementations, we would say that unary predicates with "interesting"
or no copy semantics are best avoided.
<p>In practice, most predicates have normal copy semantics. This is because
usually we invoke an algorithm in a way that the predicate is passed by
value. To do this, the predicate must be copyable. Non-copyable predicates
can be useful, but they are unusual, because they must be passed by reference,
which takes extra care and requires interesting-looking template syntax.
We discussed some of the related issues like pass-by-reference of function
objects in a previous article, how we can do it, and why we might want
to do it <a href="#3">[3]</a>. We'll spare you any further discussion of
the matter right here. Instead let’s move on to the remaining predicate
properties, which address the issue of side effects produced by a unary
predicate.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Side-Effect Properties 4, 5, and 6</h3>
<i>A unary predicate can have any side effects except modification of its
argument and invalidation of iterators or sequences that the algorithm
works with.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Standard prohibits certain side effects, but allows others. Why?
To understand this requirement, consider what happens inside an algorithm
that uses a unary predicate. There are two side-effect-producing entities:
the algorithm itself and the unary predicate. The algorithm iterates over
the sequence of input elements, inspects the elements, supplies them as
an argument to the predicate, modifies and copies them, and might produce
other side effects. The unary predicate receives a reference to an element
in the input sequence and might also inspect and modify the element and
produce other side effects. Naturally, these activities might collide.
For this reason, let us take a look at the side effects produced by a unary
predicate and classify them regarding their potential for conflict into
harmful, potentially harmful, and harmless side effects.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Harmful Side Effects</h4>
Harmful side effects invalidate any iterator or sequence that the algorithm
operates on. (No function object should ever produce a harmful side effect.
This is a general rule that applies to all function objects, not just to
predicates. The Standard does not even explicitly prohibit these side-effects,
probably because they are considered "common sense.")
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>An example of a harmful predicate would be a predicate that internally
keeps a pointer or reference to the sequence that the algorithm operates
on and uses the reference for erasing sequence elements. The removal of
elements might invalidate iterators that were supplied to the algorithm
in order to describe the input or output sequence, and under these circumstance,
the algorithm is likely to produce a program crash.
<p>Removal of sequence elements is a fairly obvious source of problems,
but at times the invalidation of the sequence is less obvious. If for instance
the algorithms relies on the sorting order of the sequence and the predicate
intentionally or inadvertently modifies the sorting order when it is invoked,
then this would lead to unpredictable results.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In any case, predicates with harmful side effects must be avoided under
all circumstances. As a rule, never use function objects that invalidate
any iterator or sequence that the algorithm operates on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Potentially Harmful Side Effects</h4>
This category of side effects is explicitly prohibited by the Standard.
All unary predicates that apply non-constant functionality to their arguments
fall into this category, because they modify sequence elements. Let us
refer to such predicates as <i>mutating</i> unary predicates. (Note the
difference between "modifying the sequence" (harmful) and "modifying the
sequence elements" (only potentially harmful): "modifying the sequence"
means that elements are inserted or removed or shuffled around so that
certain iterators or iterator ranges become invalid. "Modifying the sequence
elements" means that sequence elements are accessed and their content is
changed, but it does not invalidate any iterator.)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The potential harm of a mutating unary predicate stems from the fact
that the predicate is not the only one that can access elements from the
input sequence and change them. The algorithm itself might attempt to modify
the same sequence of elements. In such a case, there are two side-effect-producing
entities (the algorithm and the predicate), and their activities might
collide.
<p>When does such a collision happen? Not all algorithms modify elements
from the input sequence, but some of them indeed do. Algorithms fall into
several categories: non-modifying and mutating algorithms, and the mutating
algorithms can be distinguished as in-place and copy algorithms. The <i>non-modifying</i>
algorithms (e.g., <b>count_if</b>) only inspect sequence elements; they
don't change anything. The <i>mutating copy</i> algorithms (e.g., <b>replace_copy_if</b>)
do not modify elements in the input sequence, but copy them to the output
sequence; they modify elements in the output sequence. The <i>mutating
in-place</i> algorithms (e.g., <b>replace_if</b>) modify elements "in place,"
which means that they modify elements in the input sequence; they are the
critical ones. Hence, the potential conflict between predicate and algorithm
occurs for mutating in-place algorithms in conjunction with a mutating
unary predicate.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Application of two modifications to the same sequence element raises
a couple of questions such as: Which modification is performed first and
potentially overwritten by the second? Is the result predictable at all?
In order to avoid any such conflict between the algorithm and the predicate,
the Standard requires that a unary predicate must not modify the elements
in the input sequence that it receives as arguments. Note that the mutating
side effect is disallowed for <i>all</i> unary predicates, not just for
those that are supplied to mutating in-place algorithms.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This restriction is often reflected in the predicate's function signature:
typically a unary predicate takes its argument either by value or by constant
reference, in order to make sure that its argument (the referred-to input
sequence element) cannot be modified.
<h4>
Harmless Side Effects</h4>
Last, but not least, a predicate may have harmless side effects. All non-mutating
access to sequence elements falls into this category. A predicate may apply
constant functionality to its arguments; that is, it may inspect the sequence
elements, but it must not modify them. In addition, a unary predicate may
modify objects other than its argument. It may for instance have data members
and change their values. Or it may refer to unrelated element sequences
and change them. This is harmless as long as the sequences that are changed
by the predicate are not simultaneously used by the algorithm.
<h4>
Why Do We Care?</h4>
We've seen the different types of side effects that a predicate can produce
and that many of the side effects are prohibited by the Standard. Why would
we want to use predicates with side effects under these circumstances?
Is a unary predicate with side effects a rare or a fairly common case?
<p>Well, it depends. If you look at typical examples of predicates that
are given in C++ text books, then you'll find unary predicates such as
<b>isEven</b>
defined as <b>bool isEven(int elem) { return elem %2 == 0; } </b>or expressions
such as <b>bind2nd(greater&lt;int>(),4)</b>, which is a unary predicate
created from a predefined binary predicate by means of a so-called binder.
Even if you study unary predicates that are implemented as function object
types (i.e., they are classes with an overloaded function call operator),
they rarely have data members or do anything complicated, and they never
have side effects.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In practice, this is slightly different. For instance, we care about
efficiency. Obviously, it is faster to perform several things in one pass
over the sequence instead of stepping through a lengthy sequence repeatedly.
Consider a couple of examples.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Say, we have a container that represents our customer base. We need
to determine the number of all frequent buyers for our internal statistics,
and, as we go, we want to build up a mailing list because we intend to
send promotional mail to the frequent buyers. However, the mailing list
should not exceed a limit of 5,000 addressees. That's the task. How can
we achieve this? One conceivable solution is a unary predicate that yields
true for a frequent buyer and accumulates information for the mailing list
as it goes. When supplied to the <b>count_if </b>algorithm, it would produce
the desired count and would build up the mailing list as a side effect.
Such a unary predicate strictly conforms to the rules. It accepts a constant
reference to a client, inspects the client, and produces a harmless side
effect, namely the mailing list.
<p>Let us consider another, similar example. We need to remove all <i>infrequent</i>
buyers from our customer base and update the records of the remaining frequent
buyers regarding applicable discounts. Again, we try to be efficient and
want to do both in one pass over the customer base. In comparison to the
previous approach, we could try providing a unary predicate to <b>remove_if</b>
that yields true for infrequent buyers (so that the algorithm removes them)
and adds information about the discounts to the remaining buyers. In contrast
to the earlier example, this is illegal, because adding information to
elements in the input sequence is a prohibited side effect. Remember: The
predicate must not modify its argument. But that's exactly what we intend
to do: we want to update the remaining elements in the sequence. So, what
do we do?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There is not much that we can do. A thorough study of the algorithms
section of the Standard reveals that the <b>for_each</b> algorithm is the
only algorithm that accepts a function object <i>and</i> allows the function
object to modify its argument. (We discussed <b>for_each</b> in a previous
article <a href="#4">[4]</a>.) For this reason, we are very restricted
in our choice of algorithms for a given task if that task includes modification
of elements in the input sequence; <b>for_each</b> is the basically the
only choice.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The consequence is that we must split the task into the non-modifying
activities (implemented as a unary predicate for <b>remove_if</b>) and
the mutating activities (implemented as a functor for <b>for_each</b>).
This way an additional pass over the entire sequence cannot be avoided,
including the inevitable loss in efficiency.
<p>The alternatives are:
<ul>
<li>
a function object for use with <b>for_each</b> that removes <i>and</i>
modifies elements (thus repeating the functionality of <b>remove_if</b>
in our predicate, which is certainly not desirable)</li>

<li>
a user-defined version of the <b>remove_if</b> algorithm that allows modification
of elements in the input sequence (which is doable; even a copy of the
standard algorithm might do depending on how it is implemented)</li>

<li>
a manually coded algorithm (ignoring the standard algorithms altogether)</li>
</ul>
The bottom line is that unary predicates cannot be used if elements from
the input sequence must be modified.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>If such a modification is desired (e.g., for efficiency reasons), then
we must split the task into modifying and non-modifying aspects and must
accept multiple passes over the input sequence if we want to use the standard
algorithms.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Property 7</h3>
<i>A unary predicate must be order-insensitive; that is, its effects must
be independent of the order of invocation.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In conjunction with side effects of unary predicates, two other aspects
are relevant: order and number of invocation of the predicate. If a side
effect is produced each time the predicate is applied to an element of
the input sequence, then we would want to know how often and in which order
the side effects are produced. For instance, in our example, we increment
a count in order to determine the maximum size for the generated mailing
list. Naturally, it makes a difference if the predicate is applied exactly
once per element or maybe repeatedly. Depending on the nature of the side
effect, the order and number of invocations plays a role.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The number of invocations is exactly specified: algorithms like <b>count_if</b>
or <b>remove_if</b> apply the unary predicate exactly once per element
in the input sequence. Order of invocation is different: none of the algorithms
that take a unary predicate specifies the order in which it supplies sequence
elements to the predicate. As a consequence, unary predicates must be independent
of the order of invocation. If we use a predicate that depends on the order
of invocation, the result is unpredictable.
<p>Here is an example: a (order-sensitive) predicate that yields true for
every n<sup>th</sup> element in the sequence:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>class Nth {
public:
&nbsp; Nth(int n) : theN(n), theCnt(0) {}
&nbsp; bool operator()(int)&nbsp;
&nbsp; { return (++theCnt)%theN; }
private:
&nbsp; const int theN;
&nbsp; int theCnt;
};</pre>
If we supply a predicate such as <b>Nth(3) </b>to an algorithm like <b>remove_copy_if</b>,
then one might expect that it would move <i>every third element</i> from
the input sequence to the output sequence. But this is not guaranteed,
because the sequence elements are not necessarily supplied in any definite
order. All that we can reasonably rely on is that <i>a third of all elements
</i>will
be moved from the input sequence to the output sequence.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Why doesn’t the Standard give a guarantee regarding the order of invocation
of the unary predicates? This is because certain algorithms can be optimized
for certain types of iterators. For instance, an algorithm might step through
the sequence from beginning to end if the iterator is an input iterator,
but could do random jumps for a random access iterator. Since the Standard
does not want to restrict the potential for such optimizations, it does
not give any guarantees for the order of invocation of the unary predicates.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The consequence for users of the STL is that all unary predicates must
not depend on the order in which sequence elements are supplied to it.
If we want to use order-sensitive predicates, then we must implement our
user-defined algorithms that give us the guarantee we need regarding the
order of invocation of the unary predicate.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Related to the order and number of invocations of the unary predicate,
there is the following last observation.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Property 8</h3>
<i>A unary predicate need not yield the same result for different invocations
with the same argument.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This property might sound a little far-fetched. We include this into
the list of properties because we’ve observed that occasionally it is assumed
that there is an implied requirement that predicates exhibit "stable" behavior,
in the sense that they yield the same result each time they are invoked
with the same or an "equal" argument. This assumption is not justified;
the Standard does not define any such requirement.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Why then is it occasionally assumed that "stable" behavior is required
of a unary predicate? Because it would give the implementations a considerable
amount of latitude. With "stable" behavior, it would not matter how often
the predicate is called for the same sequence element, since the result
would always be the same. It would also be irrelevant whether a reference
to a sequence element is supplied to the algorithm or a temporary copy
of the element (namely an "equal" element).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>However, for unary predicates in the STL, there is no requirement of
"stable" behavior. It perfectly makes sense to define an "instable" predicate.
An example would be a predicate that yields true for all elements with
a certain property until a limit is reached. It could be used to copy a
maximum number of elements with a given property from an input sequence
to an output sequence using <b>remove_copy_if</b>.
<h3>
Summary</h3>
The following algorithms in the standard library use a unary predicate:
<b>replace_if</b>,
<b>remove_if</b>,
<b>partition</b>,
<b>stable_partition</b>,
<b>replace_copy_if</b>,
<b>remove_copy_if</b>,
<b>count_if</b>,
and <b>find_if</b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>If a unary predicate has the properties listed below, then it can be
provided to any of the algorithms listed above, and the result will be
portable and predictable.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
A unary predicate must be callable and must accept one argument and return
a Boolean value, but need not have any particular copy semantics. (Some
library implementations have restrictions in this area because they require
certain copy semantics.)</li>

<li>
A unary predicate must not modify its argument and must not invalidate
iterators or sequences that the algorithm works with, but may have any
other side effects.</li>

<li>
A unary predicate must be independent of the order of invocation and may
yield different results for different invocations with the same argument.</li>
</ul>
