<br>&nbsp;
<p>Let us revisit stream manipulators. We explained them in two articles
in
<i>C++ Report</i> last summer [<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>].
The techniques that we demonstrated for implementation of stream manipulators
were inspired by classic programming techniques that have traditionally
been used to implement manipulators using the classic, pre-standard IOStreams
library. We took those old ideas, twisted and tweaked them a little bit,
and made them work with the new templatized standard IOStreams classes.
The resulting solution works, but it turned out that the classic techniques
did not seamlessly fit into the context of a library of templates — and
almost all standard stream classes are templates these days.
<p>For those readers who cannot recall the two reference articles, we will
give a brief recap of the classic-inspired solution and its downside in
a minute. (Similar ground is covered in our IOStreams book (see <a href="#3">[3]</a>
on page 176ff.) But what we really want to discuss in this installment
of our column is not manipulators again, but application of more modern
programming techniques for implementing stream manipulators in a significantly
more elegant way. We will be using template programming techniques and
in particular the Curiously Recurring Template pattern <a href="#4">[4]</a>,
which is also referred to as <i>parameterized inheritance</i>. And we want
to demonstrate how useful function object types can be.
<h3>
Recap: Implementing Manipulators with Parameters — The Old-Style Approach</h3>
A stream manipulator is an object that we can insert into an output stream
or extract from an input stream. The effect of this insertion or extraction
is a manipulation of the stream. An example is the widely known <b>endl</b>
manipulator. Here is the classic example of its use:
<pre>cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!" &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
The <b>endl</b> manipulator is an object that can be inserted into an output
stream; the effect of which is insertion of an end-of-line character into
the stream and subsequent flushing of the stream buffers. There are countless
further pre-defined manipulators in the standard IOStreams library, such
as <b>boolalpha</b> for switching from numeric to textual display of Boolean
values, <b>noskipws</b> for suppressing white-space-skipping on input,
or <b>setw(n)</b> for setting the field width for subsequent output.
<h4>
User-Defined Stream Manipulators</h4>
The IOStreams library is extensible, and we can add user-defined special-purpose
manipulators. As an example, let us implement a multi-end-of-line manipulator,
pretty much like the standard manipulator <b>endl</b>, but with the additional
capability of inserting an arbitrary number of end-of-line characters:
<pre>cout &lt;&lt; mendl(5);</pre>
Implementing such a stream manipulator is pretty straightforward. Here
is a solution:
<pre>class mendl {
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; explicit mendl(unsigned int i) : i_(i) {}
private:
&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned int i_;


&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class charT, class Traits>
&nbsp;&nbsp; friend basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; operator&lt;&lt;(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; os
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , const mendl&amp; w)
&nbsp;&nbsp; { for (int i=0; i&lt;w.i_; ++i)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.put(os.widen('\n'));&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.flush();
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
};</pre>
We must provide an inserter, that is, an overloaded version of <b>operator&lt;&lt;</b>,
that allows insertion of an object of type <b>mendl</b> into an output
stream and performs the desired manipulation of the stream. The inserter
is implemented as a friend of class <b>mendl</b>. An expression such as
<b>mendl(5)</b>
is the construction of an unnamed object of type <b>mendl</b>, with the
integer literal <b>5</b> as the constructor argument. The constructor argument
is stored as a data member and later used to perform the manipulation.
That's one of the classic ways of implementing stream manipulators with
arguments.
<h4>
Factoring out Common Code into a Manipulator Base Class</h4>
Now, manipulators have a lot in common, and in order to avoid redundancies,
we aimed to factor out all IOStreams-specific tasks into a manipulator
base class. These IOStreams-specific chores can for instance include proper
error and exception handling, which uses the stream state judiciously,
pays attention to the stream's exception mask, and does everything in perfect
conformance with the IOStreams policies. For our purposes in this article,
we omit the error and exception handling functionality that the manipulator
base class could add. For the missing details, see page 186ff in our IOStreams
book <a href="#3">[3]</a>. The manipulator base class is called <b>one_arg_manip_weh</b>
and is designed as a base class for output stream manipulators that have
one argument, like <b>mendl</b>. Here is a sketch of the implementation:
<pre>template &lt;class charT, class Traits, class Argument>&nbsp;
class one_arg_manip_weh {
public:
&nbsp;typedef void (* manipFct)(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp;, Argument);
&nbsp;one_arg_manip_weh(manipFct pf, const Argument&amp; arg)
&nbsp;: pf_(pf), arg_(arg), error_(ios_base::goodbit) {}
private:
&nbsp;manipFct pf_;
&nbsp;const Argument arg_;
&nbsp;ios_base::iostate error_;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
friend
void do_manip(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; str,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits, Argument>&amp; oamw);
};


template &lt;class charT, class Traits, class Argument>
void do_manip(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; str,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits, Argument>&amp; oamw)
{
// do lots of stuff, and in particular call the manipulation function
&nbsp; ...
&nbsp; oamw.pf_(str,oamw.arg_);
&nbsp; ...
}

template &lt;class charT, class Traits, class Argument>
basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; operator&lt;&lt;&nbsp;
(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; os,&nbsp;
&nbsp;const one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits,Argument>&amp; oamw)
{
&nbsp;if(os.good())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do_manip&lt;charT,Traits,Argument>(os,oamw);
&nbsp;return os;
}</pre>
Again, this solution is modeled after classic IOStreams solutions. In fact,
you will find a similar base class in the IOStreams library, often named
<b>smanip</b>
or <b>_Smanip</b> or the like, which is used for implementation of the
pre-defined standard manipulators with parameters such as <b>setw(n)</b>
for instance. The key idea here is that the manipulator base class stores
the manipulator argument and a function that performs the actual manipulation.
The manipulator base class provides the required overloaded shift operators
and implements them by calling the manipulation function with the stored
argument. Note, that the manipulator function is represented in the form
of a function pointer. That's a classic C/C++ technique of passing around
functions.
<p>Using this base class, we could re-implement the <b>mendl</b> manipulator
as follows:
<pre>template &lt;class charT,class Traits=char_traits&lt;charT> >
class mendl&nbsp;
: public one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits,unsigned int>
{public:
&nbsp; explicit mendl(unsigned int i)&nbsp;
&nbsp; : one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits,unsigned int>(mendl::fct,i)
&nbsp; { }
&nbsp;private:
&nbsp; static void fct (basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; os,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned int n)&nbsp;
&nbsp; { for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.put(os.widen('\n'));&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.flush();
&nbsp; }
};</pre>
For better encapsulation, we provide the required manipulation function
as a static member function of class <b>mendl</b> and pass the pointer
to that function to the manipulator base class along with the argument
that must later be passed to the function when it is invoked.
<h4>
The Caveat</h4>
So far so good. But now we face a minor inconvenience that stems from the
fact that the standard IOStreams classes are templates taking the character
type as a template argument. In order to make the manipulator base class
universally applicable, that is, to all kinds of streams regardless of
their character type, the manipulator base class is a template, too. Consequently,
the derived manipulator class <b>mendl</b> is a class template as well.
<p>With <b>mendl</b> being a template, the manipulator expression is less
convenient than it used to be. Each time we manipulate a stream by inserting
a <b>mendl</b> object, we need to know the character type of that stream.
Instead of simply saying:
<pre>cout &lt;&lt; mendl(5); // wrong ! — does not compile
wcout &lt;&lt; mendl(5); // wrong ! — does not compile</pre>
we now have to specify the template arguments and say:
<pre>cout &lt;&lt; mendl&lt;char>(5);
wcout &lt;&lt; mendl&lt;wchar_t>(5);</pre>
That's ugly. How did that happen? Look at our manipulation function <b>mendl::fct</b>.
It calls the stream function <b>flush</b>, which is a member function of
output streams, that is, of streams derived from class <b>basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits></b>.
For this reason, it must take a <b>basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp;</b>
as an argument, and since it is a static member function of class <b>mendl</b>,
it turns the entire class into a class template. There is no way to avoid
the templatization of class <b>mendl</b> with this approach.
<p>In addition, our manipulator base class has other deficiencies: it can
only serve as a base class for manipulators with exactly one argument,
because it has only one data member for storing arguments and it is tied
to a specific function signature for declaring the function pointer type.
<p>Can we find an alternative and more flexible solution for the manipulator
base class? The goal is to provide a manipulator base class that does not
require the manipulator type to be a template and allows manipulators with
an arbitrary number and type of arguments. The intended usage for manipulators
implemented in terms of this new manipulator base class should ideally
be as convenient as:
<pre>cout &lt;&lt; mendl(5);
wcout &lt;&lt; mendl(5);
cout &lt;&lt; multi('*',80);</pre>
where <b>multi</b> is a manipulator with two arguments that insert a given
character n times into an output stream.
<h3>
Implementing Manipulators with Parameters — The Modern Approach</h3>
In order to find a better solution, let us look at the original solution
again. Here is our original base class template:
<pre>template &lt;class charT, class Traits, class Argument>&nbsp;
class one_arg_manip_weh {
public:
&nbsp;typedef void (* manipFct)(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp;, Argument);
&nbsp;one_arg_manip_weh(manipFct pf, const Argument&amp; arg)
&nbsp;: pf_(pf), arg_(arg), error_(ios_base::goodbit) {}
private:
&nbsp;manipFct pf_;
&nbsp;const Argument arg_;
&nbsp;...&nbsp;
friend
void do_manip(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; str,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits, Argument>&amp; oamw);
};

template &lt;class charT, class Traits, class Argument>
void do_manip(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; str,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits, Argument>&amp; oamw)
{&nbsp; ... oamw.pf_(str,oamw.arg_); ...&nbsp; }

template &lt;class charT, class Traits, class Argument>
basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; operator&lt;&lt;&nbsp;
(basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; os,&nbsp;
&nbsp;const one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits,Argument>&amp; oamw)
{
&nbsp;if(os.good())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do_manip&lt;charT,Traits,Argument>(os,oamw);
&nbsp;return os;
}</pre>

<h4>
Replacing Function Pointers by Function Objects</h4>
The manipulator base class stores a pointer to the manipulation function
and the argument and later uses both in the shift operator for performing
the actual manipulation by invoking the manipulation function with its
argument (indirectly via the helper function <b>do_manip</b>). Instead
of using a function pointer, we could use a function object.
<p>What is a function object? It is an object that can be called. What
does it mean to call a function object? It means invocation of a member
function of the respective function object type. Often this member function
is an overloaded version of the function call operator, which is just a
special case that allows for function call syntax. It is not required,
and in our examples below, we will use a member function named <b>fct</b>
instead.
<p>Where is the advantage over a function pointer? A function object can
know how to "call itself." In particular, it could store the parameters
that control the manipulation as data members. When we invoke a function
through a pointer, then we have to provide the function argument separately.
In contrast, when we invoke a function object, then this invocation is
a call to a member function, which has access to the function object's
data members. The information that is provided in form of the function
argument (in the pointer solution) could already be contained in the function
object as a data member. Let us see how this can be done.
<p>Here is the old implementation of <b>mendl</b>, where the manipulation
function is a static member function that takes one argument, namely the
number of times it must print the end-of-line character:
<pre>template &lt;class charT,class Traits=char_traits&lt;charT> >
class mendl&nbsp;
: public one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits,unsigned int>
{public:
&nbsp; explicit mendl(unsigned int i)&nbsp;
&nbsp; : one_arg_manip_weh&lt;charT,Traits,unsigned int>(mendl::fct,i)
&nbsp; { }
&nbsp;private:
&nbsp; static void fct (basic_ostream&lt;charT,Traits>&amp; os,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned int n)&nbsp;
&nbsp; { for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.put(os.widen('\n'));&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.flush();
&nbsp; }
};</pre>
Note, that the constructor of <b>mendl</b> receives the integral value
as an argument that will later be passed as a function argument to the
static member function <b>mendl::fct</b>. This integral value is handed
over to the manipulator base class along with the pointer to the static
member function <b>mendl::fct</b>.
<p>If we implemented <b>mendl</b> as a function object type, then it could
look like this:
<pre>&nbsp;
class mendl : public <i>manipBase</i> {
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; mendl(unsigned int n)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; : <i>manipBase(...)</i>, how_many_(n) {}
private:
&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned int how_many_;
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Ostream>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostream&amp; fct(Ostream&amp; os) const
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;how_many_; ++i)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.put(os.widen('\n'));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.flush();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return os;
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
};</pre>
The constructor of <b>mendl</b> still receives the integral value that
will later be passed as a function argument to the member function <b>fct</b>.
But this time, it stores the integral value as a data member and uses this
data member in the implementation of its non-static member function <b>fct</b>.
<h4>
Implementing the New Manipulator Base Class</h4>
We've left open so far what the manipulator base class would then look
like. Obviously it does not have to store the function argument any longer,
since the <b>mendl</b> object knows itself how many times it must print
the end-of-line character. All that the base class needs for performing
the manipulation is a <b>mendl</b> object whose member function <b>fct</b>
performs the manipulation. Instead of providing a function pointer to the
base class, we pass the manipulator object itself to the base class:
<pre>class mendl : public <i>manipBase</i> {
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; mendl(unsigned int n)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; : <i>manipBase</i>(<b>*this</b>), how_many_(n) {}
private:
&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned int how_many_;
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Ostream>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostream&amp; fct(Ostream&amp; os) const;
};</pre>
The manipulator base class must have a constructor that receives the manipulator
function object and stores it somewhere. We'll look into the details of
storing and accessing the function object later.
<p>Ideally, the manipulator base class should work with all types of manipulators,
and this is easily achievable by making it a template that takes the manipulator
type as a template parameter.
<p>In addition, the manipulator base class must provide the required shift
operator for manipulator objects. As before, we implement the shift operator
in terms of a helper function that does the actual work. The helper function
was formerly named <b>do_manip</b>; we renamed it to <b>manipulate</b>
for better distinction. The helper function performs the manipulation by
invoking the manipulator function object, (that is, its member function
<b>fct</b>),
which was previously done through the function pointer, and does all the
other interesting IOStream-specific things exactly as before.
<p>Here is tentative implementation of the manipulator base class <b>manipBase</b>:
<pre>template &lt;class Manip>&nbsp;
class manipBase
{public:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manipBase(const Manip&amp; m)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { // receive manipulator function object and store it somehow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // details later ...&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Stream>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stream&amp; manipulate(Stream&amp; str) const
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { // use the manipulator function object and call its fct() member function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // details later ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;private:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // private data considered later ...
};
template &lt;class Ostream, class Manip>
Ostream&amp;&nbsp;
operator&lt;&lt; (Ostream&amp; os, const manipBase&lt;Manip>&amp; m)
{ return m.manipulate(os); }</pre>
We introduced another minor change: we reduced the number of template parameters
of the shift operator. Previously it had the character type and the character
traits type as template parameters; now we use the stream type instead.
<h4>
Accessing the Manipulator Function Object inside the Manipulator Base Class</h4>
Where do we store the manipulator function object? We could try to store
it as a data member of the manipulator base class, like this:
<pre>template &lt;class Manip>&nbsp;
class manipBase
{public:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manipBase(const Manip&amp; m) : m_(m) {}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Stream>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stream&amp; manipulate(Stream&amp; str) const
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { // calls the manipulators's function fct()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // ... m_.fct() ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;private:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manip m_;
};</pre>
This approach does not work because it introduces a circular type dependency.
Since <b>manipBase</b> is a template, class <b>mendl</b> would be defined
as:
<pre>class mendl : public <b>manipBase&lt;mendl></b> {
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; mendl(unsigned int n)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; : manipBase&lt;mendl>(*this), how_many_(n) {}
private:
&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned int how_many_;
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Ostream>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostream&amp; fct(Ostream&amp; os) const;
};</pre>
The derived manipulator class <b>mendl</b> uses class <b>manipBase</b>
as its base class passing its own type as template argument to the base
class. The compiler cannot resolve the circular dependency between the
two types.
<p>If we cannot store the manipulator function object as a data member
and use delegation to the data member for performing the actual manipulation,
we can alternatively take advantage of the fact that <b>manipBase</b> is
a manipulator <i>base</i> class. Its sole purpose is to serve as a base
class for manipulator types that have a public member function <b>fct</b>,
which performs the actual manipulation.
<p>It is not intended that we ever create objects of the base class type,
because it does not provide any meaningful functionality by itself. Its
purpose is to decorate the actual manipulation, which is provided by the
derived manipulator type, with IOStream-specific error handling. For this
reason, we can safely assume that all references to <b>manipBase</b> objects
are actually references to derived manipulator objects. For instance, inside
the shift operator, which takes a <b>manipBase&amp; </b>argument, we would
know that the reference refers to a concrete derived manipulator object.
Under these circumstances, we can safely cast down from the base class
reference to the concrete derived class reference. With this downcast,
we get access to the actual manipulation functionality, namely member function
<b>fct</b>.
Here is what it looks like:
<pre>template &lt;class Manip> class manipBase {
public:
&nbsp;template &lt;class Stream>
&nbsp;Stream&amp; manipulate(Stream&amp; str) const
&nbsp;{ ...
&nbsp;&nbsp; // call Manip::fct()
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>static_cast&lt;const Manip&amp;>(*this).fct(str);
</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;}
};
template &lt;class Ostream, class Manip>
Ostream&amp;&nbsp;
operator&lt;&lt; (Ostream&amp; os, const manipBase&lt;Manip>&amp; m)
{ return m.manipulate(os); }</pre>
The obvious concern here is: can this crash? After all this is not even
a safe <b>dynamic_cast</b>, but an unsafe static downcast. The answer is:
no, it is perfectly safe. The only location where <b>manipBase</b>'s member
function <b>manipulate</b> is invoked is from within the shift operator.
In this context, <b>manipulate</b> is invoked on a reference to an object
of type <b>manipBase</b> itself or any type derived thereof. Otherwise
the invocation of the shift operator would just not compile. If the object
is of a derived type, then the downcast is safe.
<p>Can it happen that the referenced object passed to the shift operator
is just a base class object, and not a derived class object? Well, would
that make sense? The only accessible functionality of class <b>manipBase</b>
is its <b>manipulate</b> function, and this member function will only compile
if the generic type <b>Manip</b> (the template type argument) has a <b>fct</b>
member function. Theoretically, <b>Manip</b> could be a type that is unrelated
to class <b>manipBase</b> and has a <b>fct</b> member function, but in
that case a reference to an object of the <b>Manip</b> type cannot be passed
to the shift operator, and the <b>manipulate</b> function will never be
called. Unless you introduce evil <b>reinterpret_cast</b>s someplace, you
cannot break this code.
<h3>
Evaluation</h3>
Let's step back and see what we've done. We've been using two interesting
techniques here: parameterized inheritance and function objects.
<h4>
Parameterized Inheritance</h4>
Parameterized inheritance is also known as the Curiously Recurring Template
pattern, which can be summarized as follows (quoted from the Pattern Almanac
<a href="#5">[5]</a>):
<blockquote>A class is derived from a base class instantiated from a template.
The derived class is passed as a parameter to the template instantiation.
This pattern captures a circular dependency using inheritance in one direction
and templates in the other.</blockquote>
Our manipulator base class <b>manipBase</b> and its concrete derived classes,
such as <b>mendl</b> are an example of this pattern: the derived manipulator
type <b>mendl</b> passes itself as a template argument to its base class
<b>manipBase</b>.
The use of the safe static downcast is typical for implementation of this
pattern.
<p>You can also think of the Curiously Recurring Template pattern as a
way of static polymorphism: Our manipulator base class <b>manipBase</b>
exhibits polymorphic behavior (in its member function <b>manipulate</b>)
depending on the type that was used for instantiation. It's a <i>static</i>
polymorphism because no virtual functions are involved.
<h4>
Function Objects</h4>
Replacing function pointers with function objects greatly simplified the
solution and added a lot of flexibility. For instance, all the knowledge
regarding invocation of the actual manipulation is now encapsulated in
the function object type only. Previously, the function signature (number
and type of arguments) of the manipulation function was known to the base
class, and we needed a different base class for every new signature. The
same holds for the function arguments. Knowledge of the parameters that
control the manipulation is now located in the function object type only.
Previously, these parameters had to be passed to the base class. This better
separation of concerns frees the base class from various responsibilities.
In particular, the base class is no longer a template that depends in any
way on the stream type.
<p>Our initial goal was to find a more flexible solution for the manipulator
base class that does not require that a manipulator type is a template
and allows manipulators with an arbitrary number and type of arguments.
The intended usage for manipulators implemented in terms of this new manipulator
base class should ideally be as convenient as:
<pre>cout &lt;&lt; mendl(5);
wcout &lt;&lt; mendl(5);
cout &lt;&lt; multi('*',80);</pre>
where <b>multi</b> is a manipulator with two arguments that insert a given
character n times into an output stream.
<p>Have we achieved this? Yes, we did. Recall the implementation of <b>mendl</b>
using the new <b>manipBase</b> class:
<pre>class mendl : public manipBase&lt;mendl> {
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; mendl(unsigned int n)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; : manipBase&lt;mendl>(*this), how_many_(n) {}
private:
&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned int how_many_;
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Ostream>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostream&amp; fct(Ostream&amp; os) const
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;how_many_; ++i)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.put(os.widen('\n'));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.flush();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return os;
&nbsp;&nbsp; }

Class <b>mendl</b> does no longer depend on the stream type or its character
type. Only its member function <b>fct</b> depends on the stream type. Before,
the entire manipulator class depended on the stream type because the base
class depended on it. This was inevitable because the base class had knowledge
of the function signature of the manipulation function. With the improved
encapsulation this dependency is eliminated.
<p>Regarding improved flexibility: here is the implementation of the <b>multi</b>
manipulator with its entirely different signature. (It takes an additional
argument.) It can be easily implemented using the same manipulator base
class because the base class is not concerned with the specifics of the
manipulation any more:
<pre>class multi : public manipBase&lt;multi> {
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; multi(char c, size_t n)&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; : manipBase&lt;multi>(*this), how_many_(n), what_(c) {}
private:
&nbsp;&nbsp; const size_t how_many_;
&nbsp;&nbsp; const char what_;
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp; template &lt;class Ostream>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostream&amp; fct(Ostream&amp; os) const
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;how_many_; ++i)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.put(what_);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.flush();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return os;
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
};</pre>
With the original manipulator base class, we need an additional base class
<b>two_arg_manip_weh</b>
that can store two arguments instead of just one and accepts a different
function pointer type. Again, better encapsulation of concerns simplifies
the solution and adds flexibility too boot.
<h3>
Summary</h3>
In this article, we have studied how modern programming techniques greatly
simplify programming tasks such as implementation of stream manipulators.
We replaced function pointers by function objects, thus gaining a great
deal of flexibility, while simplifying the solution at the same time. And
we did not lose a bit in efficiency, by the way. We replaced polymorphism
via function pointers with static polymorphism via templates using the
Curiously Recurring Template pattern. We haven't been using any exotic
template features for achieving this. We don't get any more adventurous
than using a member template (the base class's <b>manipulate</b> member
function is a template), but this feature is supported by most compilers
these days. In essence, nothing should prevent you from using this solution.

We would like to give credit to our fellow columnist Kevlin Henney, whose
email inspired us to write this article. He sent us email last summer as
a reaction to our two manipulator articles and suggested an approach very
similar to the one discussed in this article, where he creatively mixed
<i>various</i>
state-of-the-art techniques, including member function templates, function
object types, overloaded function call operators, and parameterized inheritance.
For those who are interested in his ideas, they are available at <b>http://www.langer.camelot.de/IOStreams/forum.htm</b>.
