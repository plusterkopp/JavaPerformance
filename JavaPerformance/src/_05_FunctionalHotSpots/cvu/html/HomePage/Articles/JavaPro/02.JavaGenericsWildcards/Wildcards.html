<a NAME="Wildcard Instantiations of Parameterized Types"></a>1 Wildcard
Instantiations of Parameterized Types</h1>
With the release of J2SE 1.5 (announced for August 2004) parameterized
types and methods, also known as Java Generics, will be available as a
new language feature of the Java programming language. We gave an overview
of most of the Java Generics features in a previous article (see /<a href="#PRO">PRO1</a>/).&nbsp;
This time we aim to explain wildcards – another language construct relevant
in the context of Java Generics.&nbsp; Wildcards can be used for instantiation
of parameterized types.&nbsp; In its simplest form a wildcard is a question
mark “?” and permits type declarations such as List&lt;?>, for instance.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="What is the purpose of wildcards?"></a>1.1 What is the purpose
of wildcards?</h2>
Consider a hierarchy of shape classes with an abstract superclass Shape
and several subclasses such as Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, etc.&nbsp;
All shape classes have a draw() method.
<blockquote><tt>public abstract class Shape {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public abstract void draw();</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>public final class Circle {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void draw() { ... }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>public final class Triangle {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void draw() { ... }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>...</tt></blockquote>
Given a collection of shapes we might want to implement a drawAllShapes()
method.&nbsp; How would we declare this method?&nbsp; Here is a first approach
:
<blockquote><tt>public void drawAllShapes(Collection&lt;Shape> c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; for (Shape s : c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.draw();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
This method can be invoked as follows:
<blockquote><tt>Collection&lt;Shape> c = new LinkedList&lt;Shape>();</tt>
<br><tt>... fill the collection with shapes ...</tt>
<br><tt>drawAllShapes(c);</tt></blockquote>
It does, however, disallow the following invocation:
<blockquote><tt>Collection&lt;Triangle> c = new LinkedList&lt;Triangle>();</tt>
<br><tt>... fill the collection with triangles ...</tt>
<br><tt>drawAllShapes(c);</tt></blockquote>
Although triangles are shapes and have a draw() method we cannot invoke
the drawAllShapes() method supplying a collection of triangles as an argument.&nbsp;
This is because the method parameter is declared to be of type Collection&lt;Shape>
and the argument supplied is of type Collection&lt;Triangle>. Both types
are incompatible with each other.&nbsp; More generally, there is no assignment
compatibility relationship between different instantiations of the same
parameterized type.&nbsp; A Collection&lt;Triangle> cannot be assigned
to a variable of type Collection&lt;Shape>.&nbsp; This may or may not be
in line with our intuition.&nbsp; We might expect assignment compatibility,
in particular in the case of collections, because collections are similar
to arrays and built-in array types with different element types are assignment
compatible if the element types have a super-sub-type relationship.&nbsp;
For instance, a method declared as taking a parameter of type Shape[] would
accept an argument of type Triangle[].&nbsp; This type relationship is
known as covariance. It means that an array of a subtype, such as Triangle[],
is assignment compatible to an array of a supertype, such as Shape[].&nbsp;
No such covariance relationship exists for instantiations of parameterized
types.
<p>In order to make up for the lack of covariance among instantiations
of a parameterized type, the language designers invented wildcards.&nbsp;
Using wildcards we can declare the drawAllShapes() method as follows:
<blockquote><tt>public void drawAllShapes(Collection&lt;? extends Shape>
c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; for (Shape s : c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.draw();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The expression “? extends Shape” is an example of a wildcard. It stands
for a family of types, namely all types that are subtypes of Shape, the
type Shape itself included. Consequently, the instantiation Collection&lt;?
extends Shape> stands for the family of types that are instantiations of
class Collection for an element type from the family of subtypes of Shape.
<p>Given this parameter declaration we can invoke the drawAllShapes() method
as before, supplying a collection of shapes to the method:
<blockquote><tt>Collection&lt;Shape> c = new LinkedList&lt;Shape>();</tt>
<br><tt>... fill the collection with shapes ...</tt>
<br><tt>drawAllShapes(c);</tt></blockquote>
In addition we can invoke the method with a collection containing subtypes
of Shape:
<blockquote><tt>Collection&lt;Triangle> c = new LinkedList&lt;Triangle>();</tt>
<br><tt>... fill the collection with triangles ...</tt>
<br><tt>drawAllShapes(c);</tt></blockquote>
In essence, wildcards are predominantly used for definition of relatively
relaxed APIs, that is, wildcards permit declaration of methods that accept
a broad range of argument types – broader than would be possible without
wildcards.
<h2>
<a NAME="More Details Regarding the Wildcard Language Feature"></a>1.2
More Details Regarding the Wildcard Language Feature</h2>
The expression “? extends Shape” is just one example of a wildcard.&nbsp;
There is a total of 3 different wildcard flavors:
<ul>
<li>
“? extends Type” is a wildcard with an upper bound; it stands for the family
of types that are subtypes of Type.</li>

<li>
“? super Type” is a wildcard with a lower bound; it stands for the family
of types that are supertypes of Type.</li>

<li>
“?” is an unbounded wildcard; it stands for “all types”.</li>
</ul>
Wildcards can be used for instantiating parameterized types, that is, we
can form types such as Collection&lt;? extends Shape>, Comparable&lt;?
super Triangle>,&nbsp; LinkedList&lt;?>. The resulting instantiations stand
for families of types: Collection&lt;? extends Shape> represents the set
of collection types that have an element type that is a subtype of Shape.&nbsp;
Similarly, Comparable&lt;? super Triangle> stands for instantiations of
the Comparable interface that allow comparison to objects of supertypes
of Triangle. LinkedList&lt;?> comprises all instantiations of the parameterized
type LinkedList, regardless of the element type.
<p>The wildcard instantiations of parameterized types can be used as argument
and return types of methods, as type arguments to other parameterized types
and for declaration of variables.&nbsp; They can not be used for creation
of objects or arrays, that is, a wildcard instantiation is not permitted
in a new expression.&nbsp; Wildcard instantiations are not types, they
are placeholders for a member from a family of types.&nbsp; In a way, a
wildcard instantiation is similar to an interface:&nbsp; we can declare
variables of interface types, but we cannot create objects of interface
types; the created objects must be of a class type that implements the
interface.&nbsp; Similar with wildcard instantiations: we can declare variables
of a wildcard instantiated type, but we cannot create objects of such a
type; the created objects must be of a concrete instantiation from the
family of instantiations designated by the wildcard instantiation.&nbsp;
Here is an example:
<blockquote><tt>LinkedList&lt;?> list1 = new LinkedList&lt;String>();&nbsp;
// fine</tt>
<br><tt>LinkedList&lt;?> list2 = new LinkedList&lt;?>();&nbsp; // error:
cannot create objects of a wildcard type</tt>
<p><tt>LinkedList&lt;? extends Shape> list3 = new LinkedList&lt;Triangle>();
// fine</tt>
<br><tt>LinkedList&lt;? extends Shape> list4 = new LinkedList&lt;String>();
// error: does not belong to the family</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="Access Restrictions"></a>1.2.1 Access Restrictions</h3>
Reference variables or parameters of wildcard type refer to an object of
a concrete type.&nbsp; Access to the referenced object via a reference
variable or parameter of a wildcard type is restricted. The restriction
is different depending on the kind of wildcard that is being used.
<h4>
<a NAME="Rules for Unbounded Wildcards"></a>1.2.1.1 Rules for Unbounded
Wildcards</h4>
A “?” wildcard prohibits invocation of methods that take arguments of the
type that the wildcard stands for.&nbsp; For instance, the wildcard List&lt;?>
stands for an arbitrary instantiation of the parameterized type List and
the element type is unknown; it can be any type.&nbsp; When we try to add
an element to a list of elements of unknown type then there is no way of
telling whether the element to be added is of the right type.&nbsp; Here
is an example to illustrate the situation. A reference variable of type
List&lt;?> refers to an object of type that is a concrete instantiation
of the parameterized type List:
<blockquote><tt>List&lt;?> list = new LinkedList&lt;String>();</tt></blockquote>
In our example, the reference variable list refers to a list of strings.&nbsp;
If we were allowed to invoke the add() method through a List&lt;?> reference
variable we could attempt to insert any type of element into the list,
like in the example below:
<blockquote><tt>void f(List&lt;?> list) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; list.add(new Date());&nbsp; // error: must not invoke
methods that take arguments of the „?“ type</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
Method f(List&lt;?> list) is declared to accept any instantiation of List.
There is no way the compiler can know what concrete instantiation of List
the parameter of type List&lt;?> refers to.&nbsp; Hence, the compiler must
not permit invocation of the add() method, because it would permit inserting
alien elements into the list.
<p>The general rule is that through a reference variable of an unbounded
wildcard type we cannot invoke any method of the referenced object that
takes an argument of the unknown type that the “?” wildcard stands for.&nbsp;
The only exception from this rule is invocation with null as an argument,
because null has no type.&nbsp; Hence the following invocation would be
permitted:
<blockquote><tt>void f(List&lt;?> list) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; list.add(null);&nbsp; // fine</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
Conversely, methods that return an object of the unknown type may be invoked
through a reference variable of a unbounded wildcard type.
<blockquote><tt>void f(List&lt;?> list) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Object ret = list.get(0); // fine</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The invocation of the get() method is permitted because receiving elements
of unknown type does not create any problems; no matter what the type of
the elements stored in the list may be, the elements are assignment compatible
to Object.
<h4>
<a NAME="Rules for Upper Bound Wildcards"></a>1.2.1.2 Rules for Upper Bound
Wildcards</h4>
Similar rules apply to the other wildcard types.&nbsp; Via a reference
variable of an “extends” wildcard type we cannot invoke any method of the
referenced object that takes an argument of the unknown type that the “extends”
wildcard stands for, except null. Invocation of methods that return an
object of the unknown type may be invoked.&nbsp; The example below illustrates
the restrictions:
<blockquote><tt>void f(List&lt;? extends Shape> list) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; list.add(new Triangle());&nbsp; </tt>// error: must
not invoke methods that take arguments of the „? extends Shape“ type
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
Again, the compiler does not know whether the reference variable of type
List&lt;? extends Shape> refers to a list of triangles, as is assumed in
the invocation of the add() method.&nbsp; The reference variable of type
List&lt;? extends Shape> may equally well refer to a list of circles or
rectangles, in which case the insertion of a triangle into the list would
be harmful.
<p>Again, retrieving an element from the list is safe, because all elements
in the list are guaranteed to be Shapes.
<blockquote><tt>void f(List&lt;? extends Shape> list) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shape ret = list.get(0);&nbsp;&nbsp; // fine</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
Note, that for an “extends” wildcard type, different from an unbounded
wildcard type, we have more knowledge regarding the type of the returned
object.&nbsp; We know that the returned object is at least a Shape, not
just an Object.
<h4>
<a NAME="Rules for Lower Bound Wildcards"></a>1.2.1.3 Rules for Lower Bound
Wildcards</h4>
Different rules apply for “super” wildcards.&nbsp; Here it is the other
way round: invocation of methods that return an object of an unknown type
is restricted and only allowed if we make no assumptions regarding the
returned type and treat the returned object as if of type Object. Invocation
of methods that take arguments of the unknown type is permitted without
any restrictions.&nbsp; For illustration, here is an example:
<blockquote><tt>void f(List&lt;? super Triangle> list) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Triangle ret = list.get(0); // error: must not invoke
methods that return the „? super Triangle“ type</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Object&nbsp;&nbsp; obj = list.get(0); // fine</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The compiler has no way of knowing whether the reference of type List&lt;?
super Triangle> refers to a list of triangles, as the first&nbsp; invocation
of the get() method suggests.&nbsp; The references variable may well refer
to a list of Shapes and might contain a mix of various types of shapes.&nbsp;
Hence, what is returned from the get() method may be a circle or a rectangle
and not a triangle.&nbsp; The call to get() is only permitted if we treat
the return value as an Object, thus making no assumptions regarding its
type.
<p>Addition of elements to the list is permitted, but it must be visible
to the compiler that the elements are within bounds.&nbsp; Here is an example:
<blockquote><tt>void f(List&lt;? super Triangle> list) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; list.add(new Triangle());&nbsp; // fine</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shape shape = new Triangle();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; list.add(shape);&nbsp; // error: argument must be
of type Triangle</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
We may add a triangle to the list, but only if we pass it to the add()
method through a reference of the wildcard’s lower bound, namely type Triangle
in our example.&nbsp; If we supply a reference variable of a supertype
of Triangle to the add() method, like for instance a reference of type
Shape, then the compiler cannot know whether the Shape reference refers
to a Triangle or a Circle or another subtype of Shape.&nbsp; For this reason
the call to add() is rejected unless the argument is of the type that is
specified as the wildcard’s lower bound.
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>
<a NAME="Using Wildcard Instantiations"></a>2 Using Wildcard Instantiations</h1>
Let us explore typical use of the different types of wildcards.
<h2>
<a NAME="Using Wildcards With An Upper Bound"></a>2.1 Using Wildcards With
An Upper Bound</h2>
We already saw a typical example for use of a wildcard instantiations,
when we discussed the drawAllShapes() method.&nbsp; If we want that the
drawAllShapes() method&nbsp; accepts not only collections of shapes but
also collections of subtypes of Shape, then we can achieve this by declaring
the argument as a Collection&lt;? extends Shape>.
<blockquote><tt>public void drawAllShapes(Collection&lt;? extends Shape>
c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; for (Shape s : c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.draw();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>Collection&lt;Triangle> c = new LinkedList&lt;Triangle>();</tt>
<br><tt>... fill the collection with triangles ...</tt>
<br><tt>drawAllShapes(c);</tt></blockquote>
Essentially, the wildcard is used to relax the requirements imposed on
the method arguments and to permit a broader range of argument types.
<p>Programmers familiar with parameterized methods might have noticed that
the same effect can be achieved without wildcards as well:&nbsp; if we
declare the drawAllShapes() method as a parameterized method we would also
allow collections of subtypes of Shape as arguments.&nbsp; The parameterization
would look like this:
<blockquote><tt>public &lt;T extends Shape> void drawAllShapes(Collection&lt;T>
c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; for (Shape s : c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s.draw();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The parameterized drawAllShapes() method accepts collections whose element
type is a subtype of Shape, exactly as the non-parameterized version with
the wildcard instantiation does.&nbsp; The difference is that the parameterized
version does not restrict access to the method argument, while the wildcard
instantiations disallows the invocation of methods that take arguments
of the unknown type. In this example, it does not make any difference,
because the only method we invoke on the Shape type (or subtype thereof)
is method draw(), which does not take any arguments.&nbsp; In another context
the parameterized method might be more flexible than its non-parameterized
counterpart with the wildcard argument. The point to take home is: wildcards
with an upper bound can often be replaced by parameterization with a bounded
type parameter.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Using Unbounded Wildcards"></a>2.2 Using Unbounded Wildcards</h2>
Unbounded wildcards are used when the type of the type parameter does not
matter, either because the object referred to is not used or because no
methods of that type are invoked.&nbsp; An example of using an unbounded
wildcard would be a method that prints all elements in a collection, as
shown below:
<blockquote><tt>void printAll(Collection&lt;?> c) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; for (Object o : c)&nbsp; System.out.println(o.toString());</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
All that is required of the elements in the collection is that they must
have a toString() method.&nbsp; Since the toString() method is defined
in class Object, this is not much of a requirement.&nbsp; Basically we
need not know anything about the type of the objects contained in the collection.&nbsp;
Hence a declaration as Collection&lt;?> is appropriate.
<p>Note the difference between use of a Collection&lt;?> and use of a Collection&lt;Object>:
a method declared as void printAll(Collection&lt;Object> c) would not accept
a LinkedList&lt;String> as an argument, while a method declared as void
printAll(Collection&lt;?> c) permits it.&nbsp; Both expressions look like
they denote a “collection of anything”.&nbsp; The difference is that Collection&lt;Object>
is a concrete type, while Collection&lt;?> is not a type.&nbsp; It just
stands for a representative from the family of types that are instantiations
of Collection.&nbsp; Hence a method parameter declared as Collection&lt;Object>
must be of exactly that type, or a subtype thereof.&nbsp; A method parameter
declared as Collection&lt;?> can be of any type that is an instantiation
of Collection, or a subtype of any of these types.
<p>The type Collection&lt;?>&nbsp; is also different from the raw type
Collection.&nbsp; Invocation of methods that would be flagged as errors
when invoked via a reference of type Collection&lt;?> would lead to “unchecked
warning” when invoked via a reference of type Collection.&nbsp; Also, the
raw type is a concrete type, of which objects and arrays can be created,
while Collection&lt;?>&nbsp; must not appear in new expressions.
<p>Unbounded wildcards are also used for partial instantiations and express
that no requirements are imposed on a type. Here is an example.&nbsp; Say,
we have a parameterized pair class with two fields of different unknown
types:
<blockquote><tt>class Pair&lt;S,T> {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private S first;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private T second;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;A extends S> void setFirst(Pair&lt;A,?> p) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first = p.first;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The parameterized class Pair&lt;S,T> has two instance fields of type S
and T respectively. The declaration of the parameter of method setFirst()
as a Pair&lt;A,?> indicates that the method has no interest in the second
instance field of the pair.&nbsp; The type Pair&lt;A,?> would denote a
partial instantiation of the parameterized Pair type.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Using Wildcards With A Lower Bound"></a>2.3 Using Wildcards With
A Lower Bound</h2>
Wildcards with a lower bound are used for a similar purpose as wildcards
with an upper bound: they are used as arguments types of methods and relax
the requirements imposed on the argument type.&nbsp; Let us take a look
at an example. Consider a class hierarchy of value types such as the following:
<blockquote><tt>class Person {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private String firstName;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private String lastName;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private Date&nbsp;&nbsp; dateOfBirth;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>class Employee extends Person {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private Person Supervisor;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
If the classes in such a hierarchy of value classes were supposed to implement
a parameterized interface such a Comparable we run into the problem that
super- and subclass cannot implement different instantiations of the same
parameterized interface, although semantically it would make a lot of sense.&nbsp;
What we would like to do – but are not permitted to do - is the following:
<blockquote><tt>class Person implements Comparable&lt;Person> {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private String firstName;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private String lastName;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private Date&nbsp;&nbsp; dateOfBirth;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public int compareTo(Person other) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>class Employee extends Person implements Comparable&lt;Employee>
{&nbsp; // error: already implements Comparable</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private Person Supervisor;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public int compareTo(Employee other) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The compiler rejects the declaration of the subclass because it would implement
different instantiations of the same interface, namely Comparable&lt;Person>
and Comparable&lt;Employee>, which is not permitted.&nbsp; The restriction
stems from the fact that parameterized types and methods are translated
by type erasure.&nbsp; In the process of type erasure the two instantiations
of the parameterized interface are mapped onto the raw type and there would
be no longer a difference between the interface that the super- and subclass
implement.
<p>The result is that the superclass determines which instantiation of
a parameterized interface all its subclasses implement.&nbsp; This, on
the other hand, renders it impossible to pass the subclass to certain methods,
unless the methods use wildcards with lower bounds.&nbsp; Below is an example
of such a method. But&nbsp; let us first fix our class hierarchy, so that
all classes in the hierarchy of&nbsp; Person classes would implement Comparable&lt;Person>:
<blockquote><tt>class Person implements Comparable&lt;Person> {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private String firstName;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private String lastName;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private Date&nbsp;&nbsp; dateOfBirth;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public int compareTo(Person other) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>class Employee extends Person {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; private Person Supervisor;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public int compareTo(Person other) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
Now, consider a method that asks for comparable objects:
<blockquote><tt>&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T>> void someMethod(T arg1,
T arg2) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... arg1.compareTo(arg2) ...</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
This method can be invoked with reference variables of type Person as arguments,
but an argument of type Employee would not be accepted, because an Employee
is comparable to Person, but not to an Employee.&nbsp; In other words,
the Employee would not be within bounds.&nbsp; The code snippet below illustrates
the situation:
<blockquote><tt>Person p1 = new Employee(“Peter”, “Miller”, new Date(4,3,69));</tt>
<br><tt>Person p2 = new Employee(“Jim”, “Anderson”, new Date(10,8,84));</tt>
<p><tt>someMethod(p1, p2);&nbsp; // fine</tt>
<p><tt>Employee e1 = new Employee(“Peter”, “Miller”, new Date(4,3,69));</tt>
<br><tt>Employee e2 = new Employee(“Jim”, “Anderson”, new Date(10,8,84));</tt>
<p><tt>someMethod(e1, e2);&nbsp; // error:&nbsp; arguments are not within
bounds</tt></blockquote>
As the example demonstrates, it is essential that methods that take parameters
through a parameterized interface type are declared to accept upper bound
wildcard instantiations of the parameterized interface instead of concrete
instantiations.&nbsp; Otherwise, applicability of the method would be severely
– and unnecessarily – restricted.
<p>Let us relax the method signature. If we declare the method using an
upper bound wildcard instantiation – instead of the concrete instantiation
- the method accepts super- and subclass objects as arguments, that is,
Person and Employee objects would be permitted.
<blockquote><tt>&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T>> void someMethod(T
arg1, T arg2) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... arg1.compareTo(arg2) ...</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The example nicely illustrates the need for lower bound wildcards. They
help solving a problem that would otherwise remain insurmountable.&nbsp;
Classes in a class hierarchy can never implement different instantiation
of the same parameterized interface; they must implement the same parameterized
interface, namely the one that the topmost superclass decided to implement.&nbsp;
Methods taking arguments that must implement a concrete instantiations
of the parameterized interface type would accept only superclass objects.
With the use of lower bound wildcard instantiations these methods are substantially
more useful.
<p>Note also, that lower bound wildcards – different from upper bound wildcards
– cannot be replaced by a parameterization of the method itself.&nbsp;
This is because type variables can only have upper bounds, but no lower
bounds, while for wildcards both variants exist.
<h3>
<a NAME="Remaining Limitations"></a>2.3.1 Remaining Limitations</h3>
While the upper bound wildcard solves the problem discussed above, there
are still cases, in which not even wildcards come to rescue.&nbsp; If the
interface defined a method that returned a value of the wildcard type,
instead of taking it as an argument, then we would be limited by the rule
that methods returning values of the unknown type cannot be invoked through
a reference to a lower bound wildcard.&nbsp; Here is an example using a
parameterized interface Copyable that has a value returning method copy()
and a hierarchy of classes that implement the interface :
<blockquote><tt>interface Copyable&lt;T> {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; T copy();</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>class Person implements Copyable&lt;Person> {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public Person copy() { ... }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<br><tt>class Employee extends Person {</tt>
<br><tt>...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public Employee copy() { ... }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
As discussed earlier, a method such as the following would be problematic:
<blockquote><tt>&lt;T extends Copyable&lt;T>> T produceCopy(T arg) {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; return arg.copy();</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
This method does not permit Employees as arguments:
<blockquote><tt>Person p1 = new Employee(“Peter”, “Miller”, new Date(4,3,69));</tt>
<p><tt>Person p2 = produceCopy(p1);// fine</tt>
<p><tt>Employee e1 = new Employee(“Peter”, “Miller”, new Date(4,3,69));</tt>
<p><tt>Employee e2 = produceCopy(e1); // error:&nbsp; arguments are not
within bounds</tt></blockquote>
Use of a lower bound wildcard would in theory allow Employees as arguments,
but would disallow invocation of the copy() method inside method produceCopy():
<blockquote><tt>&lt;T extends Copyable&lt;? super T>> T produceCopy(T arg)
{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; return arg.copy();&nbsp; // error: type „? super T“
incompatible with type T</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt></blockquote>
The value returned from the copy() method would be of type “? super T”,
which means it can be of any supertype of T.&nbsp; Arbitrary supertypes
of T are not necessarily assignment compatible to the declared return type
T, and for this reason the compiler rightly complains.

<h1>
<a NAME="Summary"></a>3 Summary</h1>
Wildcards are part of the language extension known as Java Generics and
added as a new language feature in Java 1.5.&nbsp; Wildcards can be used
as the type argument of a parameterized type and represent a member from
a family of types.&nbsp; Three different types of wildcards exist: the
unbounded wildcard, wildcards with a lower and wildcards with an upper
bound.&nbsp; Wildcard instantiations of parameterized types are typically
used as parameter and return types in method declarations and permit a
broader range of arguments than would be possible without use of wildcards.
