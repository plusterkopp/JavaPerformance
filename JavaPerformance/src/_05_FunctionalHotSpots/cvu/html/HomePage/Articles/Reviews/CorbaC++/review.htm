long-awaited title, <i>Advanced CORBA Programming with C++</i> contains
the most comprehensive coverage of CORBA programming in C++ that we've
come across to date. Compared to the first CORBA book we read about three
years ago — <i>The Essential Distributed Objects Survival Guide</i> by
Robert Orfali et al (John Wiley &amp; Sons), which was rather frustrating
to read and lacked details — <i>Advanced CORBA Programming with C++</i>
has it all.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>It's not that we as programmers need
to understand the intricacies of underlying mechanisms such as IIOP if
we want to use an ORB, but it's good to know in principle what is going
on under the hood. Henning and Vinoski dig deep and go beyond the CORBA
specification and, in many places, the various APIs to provide invaluable
insights into CORBA's internal mechanisms. In a way this book provides
you with many more details than you might want to know. However, not only
is this an in-depth CORBA reference, it is also a tutorial that comes with
countless case studies and code examples. Even better, it keeps an eye
on pitfalls and performance impediments. The authors also discuss design
decisions and often come up with helpful recommendations.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><i>Advanced CORBA Programming with
C++</i> is most decidedly not a book for beginners. You need to be literate
in C++, you need to know what CORBA is from a high-level perspective, and
you should also have experience with network programming and multi-threading.
But if you meet these prerequisites and are looking for in-depth coverage
of CORBA that enables you to implement industrial-strength CORBA-based
systems, then this is the right book for you.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Henning and Vinoski's book covers
CORBA 2.3 as defined by the OMG (of which the authors are active members)
and covers the latest features that your ORB might not even have implemented
yet. It starts with an introduction showing a minimal CORBA application
and introduces the concepts of CORBA. Then it focuses on CORBA with C++:
the IDL mapping, the POA (Portable Object Adapter), and object lifecycle
problems. Next come chapters devoted to CORBA networking protocols, dynamic
CORBA, CORBA services (Naming, Trading, Events), and--to top it off--multi-threaded
servers and strategies for optimizing performance and scalability.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Despite its hefty 1,000 pages, Henning
and Vinoski still feel that the book is too short. Indeed, they had to
omit novel and less essential features such as the transactions and security
services. Nonetheless, this book is the most comprehensive, in-depth, and
practical reference you can find.&nbsp;</font></font>
