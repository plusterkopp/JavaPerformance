the past couple of years new component models have emerged: Microsoft's
Transaction Server (MTS), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and CORBA Components.
These component models form the foundation for a completely new approach
in the world of enterprise information technology, where business components
are independent pluggable software implementations of autonomous business
concepts.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>The
technical foundation has been established with the aforementioned component
models, but the need for understanding how to build and use business components
has grown immensely. <i>Business Component Factory</i>, by Peter Herzum
and Oliver Sims, is a book that can help satisfying this need.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>The
title "Business Component Factory" might sound a bit misleading, especially
for IT specialists familiar with the design pattern known as the <i>factory</i>
pattern. In this book, however, the term has a completely different meaning.
It is used in order to point out that the book is not only about business
components in general but also about the development process and the techniques
that allow to produce business components. The book addresses these different
aspects by devoting major sections to each of the aspects. It contains
three parts:&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Conceptual
Framework (240 pages)</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>This
part explains business component systems and how they relate distributed
components. In general, the book does not delve deeply into the technical
details of any concrete component model. Compared to the other parts of
the book, this is the most technical, or let's say architectural, part.
It is published in Wiley's OMG series; for this reason one might it to
focus on CORBA Components as a foundation for business objects. This is
not the case. Instead, it coins the expression "distributed component"—an
abstraction that could be any type of business component foundation—and
devotes a chapter of around 35 pages to the discussion of the typical functionality
and characteristics of a distributed component in general. Based on this
discussion it examines business components built on top of distributed
components and business component systems constructed from business components.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Component
Factory Setup (180 pages)</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>This
part of the book focuses on the development process for business components
and the three views—or "architectures" as they are called in the book—that
are essential for a successful project. After a chapter that discusses
the process for business component development, each of the three architectures
is discussed: technical architecture, application architecture, and project
management architecture. The authors discuss issues relevant to each of
the three architecture. The chapter about technical architecture, for example,
looks at topics such as concurrency, asynchronous messaging, transactions,
persistence, error handling, etc.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Manufacturing
Component-Based Software (130 pages)</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>The
last part of the book contains three chapters. The first two discuss the
concrete modeling and design techniques for a business-component-based
system: one chapter is devoted to the modeling of the business domain and
one to the design of the solution domain.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>The
book closes with a chapter on the possibilities and challenges for a transition
from today's classic software development to a "business component factory,"
as described in the book.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>In
sum, <i>Business Component Factory</i> contains a lot of knowledge and
information about business components and the process and techniques for
finding, implementing, and using them.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>How
does this book relate to other titles on components? For complete coverage
of component technology you need only three books:&nbsp;</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>A book
like <i>Component Software</i> by Clemens Szyperski, which explains the
foundation of component technology and its relationship to object orientation</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>This book,
<i>Business
Component Factory</i>, for understanding the development process for component-based
software development</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>A book
about the technical aspects of the component model under consideration
(pick any one of them; there is an abundance of titles on EJB, MTS, and
CORBA Components)&nbsp;</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1><i>Business
Component Factory</i> is a must-read for any project that either plans
to move into this direction or is already on its way. Yet it is not only
of value to projects that are about to get started with business component–based
development. Even those projects that have already adopted the usage of
business objects, more or less successfully, can benefit from this book.
Both authors have a lot of experience in this field and comparing their
approaches and techniques with the own experiences will certainly lead
you to explore new and surprising ideas.&nbsp;</font></font>
