<td VALIGN=TOP><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font color="#333399"><font size=+2>H</font></font><font size=-1>ere's
a book for the serious Java developer. <i>Java Language Specification,
Second Edition</i>, by James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy Steele, and Gilad Bracha,
provides a formal specification of the Java programming language. It is
not a book that the average Java programmer needs to look at; it is a reference
for gurus only. Do you aim to build a Java compiler, or are you interested
in the details of the language semantics? Then you'll want this book.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Once
in a while normal Java textbooks fail to answer questions that the Java
language specification can answer. Such questions include:&nbsp;</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>What are
the exact rules for conversions between reference types? (In other words,
under which circumstances do I get a ClassCastException?)</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>What is
the precise order of initialization of instance fields?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>When are
class fields initialized?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>What is
the order of finalization, if any?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>When does
an object become finalizable or unreachable, and what are the precise consequences?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Is access
to variables guaranteed to be atomic?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>What exactly
does it mean if a variable is volatile? Does it guarantee atomicity for
all types of objects?&nbsp;</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>And so
on.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>These
aren't questions you are usually interested in. Only under extreme circumstances
do these issues really matter. Textbooks typically do not delve deeply
into every gory detail of the Java Language Specification, but focus instead
on the most common cases. This way they avoid overwhelming the reader,
which is probably a good idea. The JLS in contrast <i>must</i> go into
every detail, because it aims to specify the language fully.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Naturally,
a formal specification is hard to read and understand, because it uses
formal language and is full of technical terms and cross-references. In
fact, the HTML version of the JLS, which you can <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/index.html" target="_blank">download
from Sun's Web site</a> makes it much easier to use the cross references.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Those
of you who have been using the first edition of the language specification
(JLS 1) might be interested in the differences between it and this second
edition. The most obvious change is that the entire API specification has
been removed. The API has grown enormously since 1996 and a formal specification
of the JDK 1.3 packages does not fit into a single volume of any reasonable
size. As a result, this book is the specification of the core language
only.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>A couple
of features have been added to the core of the language since the first
edition's publication. Additions include nested types (often referred to
as "inner classes") and strict floating point arithmetic. Naturally, JLS
2 contains specifications of these language features.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>There
are other changes as well, some of which are kind of confusing. For instance,
JLS 1 coined the technical terms "active and passive use" (a class is initialized
at its "first active use"). In JLS 2 the term "active use" no longer exists.
Instead, the description has been replaced by wording that expresses basically
the same, but in different words. Sadly, <i>Java Language Specification,
Second Edition</i> does not indicate what was changed or why. So we'll
never know why there is no longer any "active use" in Java.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Sometimes
we wished we had the JLS 1 we are familiar with and the new JLS 2, side
by side, so that we could match what we know from JLS 1 with what is specified
in JLS 2. You may wish you could do that too.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>We
didn't care much for this book's index because it didn't help us find what
we were looking for. For instance, we tried to look up information about
the creation of instances of inner classes. We vaguely remembered that
the syntax involves the keyword "new." Did looking up "new" help? No. There
isn't even an entry for "new"! What about "creation"? That took a while.
Here's where we found it, under the Qs: "qualified class instance creation
expression." If you know exactly what you're looking for, you can find
it; otherwise, it's difficult.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Criticisms
aside, we feel that <i>Java Language Specification, Second Edition</i>
is an indispensable part of every serious programmer's library of Java
titles. Once and a while you'll appreciate having the definite reference
available when you desperately need information about a certain detail
of the language. This book might be your last resort. And what you don't
find here, you'll probably find in the <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201432943/o/qid=987536249/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/102-6641622-8732903" target="_blank">Java
