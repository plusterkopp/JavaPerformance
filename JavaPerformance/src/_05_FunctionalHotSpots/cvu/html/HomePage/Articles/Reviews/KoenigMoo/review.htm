Koenig and Barbara E. Moo's <i>Accelerated C++: Practical Programming By
Example</i> is an introductory C++ book that takes an unusual approach
in teaching C++. It uses the standard library from the start. The classic
way of presenting C++ is, by contrast, a feature-oriented approach. All
language features are covered before the standard library is discussed.
Koenig and Moo do it the other way around. They first explain how to use
standard-library abstractions before they cover what it takes to define
one's own abstractions. The resulting tour of C++ is refreshing and enlightening.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>For
illustration of the radically different style let us take a look at the
first chapter. It's amazing how many C++ concepts can be explained just
by using the simple "Hello World" program as an example. Already within
the first dozen pages, the reader learns about the following:&nbsp;</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Lexical
conventions such as the syntax for C++ comments and string literals</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>The distinction
between core language and standard library abstractions</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Program
organization into definitions and headers</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>#include
directives and standard headers</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Statements
and blocks, braces, and semicolons</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Names
and namespaces, scopes and scope operator</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Output
streams and output operators</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Types
and objects</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Expression
evaluation, side-effects, associativity of operators.&nbsp;</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>All chapters
in <i>Accelerated C++</i> are nicely organized. They have a core part,
which takes a concrete programming task and uses it to explain new concepts,
and end with a section that summarizes the concepts and adds details where
necessary, followed by a list of suggested exercises.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Taking
a look at the book as a whole, you can observe that it basically falls
into two parts. Roughly the first half of the book concentrates on examples
of using the standard library abstractions. The second half of the book
talks about defining your own abstractions. This is an uncommon, yet very
sensible approach to the language. Before learners can consider implementing
reusable abstractions themselves, they probably first want to know how
to use the existing abstractions.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>In
addition to these two parts, <i>Accelerated C++</i> contains two appendices
that give an excellent overview of the language features and library abstractions.
The level of detail provided in these two appendices is just right—not
too many details but enough to render them useful as quick references.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>This
book is definitely worth reading. Although the book's didactic approach
is unusual, the book is not at all shallow—nor does it miss important points.
Indeed, the choice of topics is very good. Readers learn most of what they
would be learning in a classic C++ introduction. At the same time, the
authors avoid overwhelming their readers with details of each and every
language feature. For instance, they include advanced concepts such as
smart pointers and reference counting, which you don't normally find in
introductory C++ textbooks. Conversely, you won't find a detailed discussion
of how to overload each overloadable operator, which is sometimes discussed
at length in regular C++ textbooks, because it's simply not an everyday
issue for novice C++ programmers. For the beginner it's more important
to be productive in practice as soon as possible rather than to know all
the available language features in theory.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1><i>Accelerated
C++: Practical Programming By Example</i> can be used for learning C++
if a programmer already knows C. But it's probably even more interesting
to a C++ programmer who has rudimentary knowledge of C++ (such as after
a regular "Introduction to C++" class) and who seeks deeper understanding
of it.&nbsp;</font></font>
