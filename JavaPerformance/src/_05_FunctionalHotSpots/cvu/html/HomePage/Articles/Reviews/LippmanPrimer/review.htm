lot has changed in the C++ world since the second edition of Stan B. Lippman's
<i>C++
Primer</i> was published in 1991. The biggest event that happened in the
meantime was the standardization of the C++ programming language. Consequently,
it is not surprising that the newly published third edition differs significantly
from the second edition. Two obvious changes can be noticed without even
opening the book:</font></font>
<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>It doubled in size (now: 1,200+ pages).&nbsp;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Jos&eacute;e Lajoie joined Stan Lippman
as co-author. Jos&eacute;e was heavily involved with the C++ standardization
process: for three years she was vice chair of the C++ standard committee
and for four years she lead the core language working group.</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>The first and second editions of the
<i>C++
Primer</i> were recognized as classic C++ textbooks for C++ beginners,
easier to understand and written in a more tutorial style than the corresponding
editions of Bjarne Stroustroup's <i>The C++ Programming Language</i>. This
characterization still holds for the third edition as well. In addition,
the third edition of <i>C++ Primer</i> covers all new language features—such
as namespaces, RTTI, and new style casts—plus the C++ standard library
(except the support for internationalization and the numeric library).</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Another improvement to the
third edition is the organization and treatment of advanced features. The
new edition contains more extensive descriptions of C++ language rules
than its predecessor—for example, the type conversion rules are now covered
in depth. To prevent a C++ beginner from getting overwhelmed by details,
these sections are indicated by a special marker. This way it's easy to
recognize which section can be skipped when the book is read as an introductory
textbook.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Moreover, language concepts
are combined with typical idioms that show how these language features
can be used most effectively. Also, potential pitfalls are pointed out.
An example for a new C++ idiom can be found in chapter 12.3 about Function
Objects: It demonstrates how the concept of classes and the ability to
overload the function call operator can be combined to implement functions
as objects. Differences to functions are discussed: when passed as a parameter,
a function object's operator() can be inlined while a function pointer
cannot; function objects can have state, functions cannot, etc.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>&nbsp;<i>C++ Primer</i> is an excellent
tutorial for software developers who start with the C++ language. This
new edition is equally interesting for people who are already familiar
with the C++ basics and need information about advanced language features
and the changes introduced by the standardization.</font></font>
