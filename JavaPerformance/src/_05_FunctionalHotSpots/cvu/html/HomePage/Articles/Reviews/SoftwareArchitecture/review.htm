<td WIDTH="60%"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i><font size=-1>&nbsp;</font></i><font color="#333399"><font size=+2>T</font></font><font size=-1>oday's
most widely accepted and discussed processes for software development are
Rational's Unified Process (RUP) and Extreme Programming (XP). What both
have in common is that they cover the whole process of software development
from the early vision of a system to its maintenance cycles.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>The
methods and ideas presented in <i>Applied Software Architecture</i> are
different. Authors Christine Hofmeister, Robert Nord, and Dilip Soni concentrate
exclusively on the development of the software architecture, which is a
distinct design phase. They define it as "the bridge between the system
requirements and implementation. This design phase comes after the domain
analysis, requirement analysis, and risk analysis, and before detailed
design, coding, integration, and testing." All of these development phases
can overlap or reoccur cyclically in the above listed order when development
is incremental. The result of the software architecture development phase,
the authors contend, is "a structural plan that describes the elements
of the system, how they fit together, and how they work together to fulfill
the system's requirements."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>In
describing this phase, the authors clash with the more established process
models because they define their own independent, alternative methods and
results. In one sense, this book completes the established process models
because it discusses the software architecture development phase in greater
detail than you'll find anywhere else.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1><i>Applied
Software Architecture</i> is based on a study of system architectures by
the authors at Siemens Corporate Research in Princeton, New Jersey. They
examined the development of large, complex software systems. As the authors
put it: "The purpose of the study was first to understand the architectural
issues facing designers, then to understand current practices, including
best practices. We were looking for commonalties across domains and for
underlying principles that lead to good and useful software architectures."&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>The
result of this study is an approach to find the correct software architecture
for a system by developing four loosely coupled views, in which each view
concentrates on a certain aspect of the system:&nbsp;</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1><b>Code
view</b> describes the structure of the organization of the source code
into object code, libraries, versions, and build times</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1><b>Module
view</b> shows the decomposition of the system into modules and the partitioning
of modules into layers (i.e., large-grain abstractions) and the interfaces
between them</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1><b>Execution
view</b> describes the dynamic elements of the system and how they interact
in the flow of control and data</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1><b>Conceptual
view</b> is the most high-level view; closely tied to the application domain,
it shows how the overall architecture maps to the vision of the system&nbsp;</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1><i>Applied
Software Architecture</i> explains these views, the relationship between
them, and how to develop them (in 170-page detail), together with four
case studies (each about 40 to 50 pages):&nbsp;</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Digital
I&amp;C systems for nuclear power plants</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Embedded
real-time patient monitoring system</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Central
patient monitoring station</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Product
line of computer-controlled digital switching systems&nbsp;</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>Although
these four systems had not been designed with the authors' suggested approach,
these case studies are used to demonstrate what would go into each view,
which engineering concerns would be addressed by each view, and how the
notations (based on UML) can be used to describe it.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><font size=-1>As
you can probably see from this review, the model presented in <i>Applied
Software Architecture</i> is a highly formal approach best suited to the
development of large-scale systems. For this reason, the book might be
an interesting inspiration for people interested in the process of software
development for large systems, or how architecture of a large software
system can be designed and described.&nbsp;</font></font>
