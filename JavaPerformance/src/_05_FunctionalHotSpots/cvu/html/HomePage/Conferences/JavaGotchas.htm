<td>A quote from an interview with George Paolini, Director of Corporate
Marketing at JavaSoft, published in JavaREPORT 5/98:
<blockquote>Q: <i>When will Java win over the C++ developers once and for
all ?</i>
<p>A: <i>I think we're winning them over now. On the programming language
side, C++ programmers are probably the most adept at picking up Java. For
them it's basically about leaving out a lot of the trapdoors that were
developed in C++ and unlearning a lot of bad habits.&nbsp;</i></blockquote>

<p><br>This and other statements which advertise Java as a "simplified
C++" created the myth that C++ programmers would almost automatically master
Java. The reality, in contrast, shows that Java opens quite a number of
trapdoors especially to Java programmers with a strong C++ background.&nbsp;
<br>The reason for this is the fact that Java shares most of the syntax
and numerous concepts with C++, and exactly this property misleads former
C++ programmers. Language constructs that are syntactically identical in
Java and C++ have entirely different semantics in both languages. Typical
examples are assignment and comparison of objects: they are syntactically
identical, but exhibit different behavior in both languages. The construction
of objects differs in subtle ways between C++ and Java. Reference variables
in Java look like C++ references, but behave like C++ pointers. In addition,
it turns out that common C++ idioms such as value semantics, const-correctness,
or resource management techniques cannot be transported to Java.
<br>Based on several years of practical Java experience, this tutorial
aims to shed some light on obstacles and misunderstandings that come up
during the transition from C++ to Java. This is not a talk about the fact
the Java lacks templates and that C++ lacks garbage collection, but about
the subtle differences between Java and C++. Considering that many C++
idioms are not suitable for Java programming, the tutorial also explains
corresponding Java idioms, and how they relate to the respective C++ idioms.</td>
