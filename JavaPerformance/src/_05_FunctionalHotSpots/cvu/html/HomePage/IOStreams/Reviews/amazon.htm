delivers anything you could possibly want to know about streams and locales.
The book might seem dry at times but im so glad I muddled through this
book the first time; i cant imagine programming with out it!&nbsp;
<br>You will be able to write flawless file I/O thats easily extensible
and maintainable. All with less code than the C-style I/O. Almost all C++
books teach C style I/O for some reason, and you will cringe at that after
you absorb this book.&nbsp;
<br>You will be able use your new code with the STL seamlessly giving you
even more robust and easy to maintain code. I still get giddy when i see
how elegant and flawless your code can be when you use the standard library
(the non-depracted part) to the fullest.&nbsp;
<br>The auther points out that some example code may not work on MSVC++
6.0. Well, thats what i use and found little code i cant compile without
modifications; and the code you cant compile you will be able to figure
out good workaround right away if you know what VC 6.0 cant do; even I
found good workarounds.&nbsp;
<br>You may think Iostreams and locales arent worth knowing about if you
program windows apps. This is wrong.&nbsp;
<br>This book is good in so many ways, even the appendiecs were great source
of new info. I still reach for this book at least once a week. This is
my best buy period.</td>

<td COLSPAN="2" WIDTH="100%">When people think of C++ standard libraries,
they think of the STL. There are dozens of books on the STL, and everyone
is taking advantages of its features to get good algorithms that don't
reinvent&nbsp;
<br>the wheel.&nbsp;
<br>As this book points out, IOStreams is perhaps the most-overlooked part
of standard C++. It has just as many features as the STL, and can help
you write less, better code if you take advantage of it. If&nbsp;
<br>you have ever spent a few days writing a buffer class, you didn't have
to; The IOStreams streambuf is comletely extensible and customizable.&nbsp;
<br>Even better, IOStreams is a complex, high-performance library written
by a C++ expert from Bell Labs. Most of us C++ programmers don't think
about how IOStreams works, other than to write&nbsp;
<br>'&lt;&lt;' a few times. OO design doesn't get any better than that.
This book is also an excellent case study on the IOStreams library, touching
on the proper use of multiple inheritence, and the&nbsp;
<br>benefits of static type checking. If a library can be this efficient
and extensible, while being as easy to use as typing '&lt;&lt;', there
is something every C++ programmer can learn from its design.&nbsp;
<br>The book is even endorsed by Jerry Schwarz, the man who invented IOStreams,
and has a forward written by him. If you own two STL books, but not this
book, I think you've made a mistake. This&nbsp;
<br>should be the third C++ book you buy, after a language reference and
STL reference. It is that useful and interesting.</td>

<td COLSPAN="2" WIDTH="100%">The reason why I bought this book was the
wish to learn more about the C++ Standard. When I held the book in my hand
the first time I was not shure if it would be worth the time reading it.
It seemed only be useful for a DOS - like software, not for my GUI problems.&nbsp;
<br>So I was very surprised in a good sense to read about ideas how to
use IOStreams for GUI -&nbsp;
<br>internationalization (I18N), described on pages 175 and 225. The IOStreams
library, as it is described by the authors, is a better answer to my I18N
- problems than all other three GUI - libraries I know. It offers more
flexibility.&nbsp;
<br>An other treasure was the techniqe of two-phase polymorphic dispatch
described in this excellent book. This technique allows me a much more
flexible design than in the past. If the customer asked for new features
I often had to change my class hierarchy (and all classes in it) by adding
new virtual functions. It is cumbersome if it is code of a library. The
two-phase polymorphic dispatch shows an alternative.
<br>The third (but not the last) treasure are the appendices. They are
a good reference for C++ refinements.&nbsp;
<br>The thought I perhaps would not have read this book worries me, I had
missed a chance.&nbsp;
<br>Many thanks to the authors writing such an excellent book.</td>

<td>&nbsp;As the authors point out, the STL comprises about a third of
the standard library, and the streams and locales portion another third,
yet whereas there are dozens of books available describing STL, this is
the only up-to-date treatment of streams and locales that I have come across.&nbsp;
<br>Fortunately, it's very well-written, by knowledgeable authors. The
text is fairly dense reading, but it flows logically, and the information
has not been put together this well anywhere else that I have seen.&nbsp;
<br>Chances are, if you are a C++ programmer, you use the streams library
fairly regularly. You may not, however, be familiar with the details of
the streams design. Similarly, my experience has been that I may have touched
upon locales occasionally, but did not have a detailed grasp of the breadth
of the design.&nbsp;
<br>Because of this, and because these may not be everyday issues, it is
very valuable to have a detailed reference book to refer to when you need
it. This book fits the bill very nicely.</td>

of computer books, both as an educational and reference tool.&nbsp;
<br>It is Well-written: Easy to understand and follow concepts, many timely
examples are found all through the text.&nbsp;
<br>It is Well-organized: Easy to navigate, information is organized into
'digestible chunks' to ease the learning and absorption process.&nbsp;
<br>It is Concise, yet thorough: No information overload, though it still
presents (in a logical, easy-to-follow manner) a wealth of detailed information
for the iostream programmer.&nbsp;
<br>It is Up-to-date: Published in January 2000.&nbsp;
<br>I have found it an invaluable and essential tool in learning and using
the iostreams library,&nbsp;
<br>arguably one of the most-used libraries in the C++ Standard. This book
will help you understand and use the iostream library to it's fullest potential,
the way it was meant to be&nbsp;
<br>used.&nbsp;
<br>Don't get trapped by design errors due to misunderstanding or not knowing
about features&nbsp;
<br>of iostreams: Get this book.&nbsp;
<br>I would also suggest The C++ Standard Library, by Nicolai M. Josuttis
for information on&nbsp;
<br>all aspects of the STL.&nbsp;</td>

<td>This book is it. There is no other text which covers the full I/O Streams
library as of the ISO C++99 standard. B. Stroustrup's book "The C++ Programming
language" has one chapter of 50+ pages on streams. Its enough to get you
started, but not enough if you want to make roll your own. Your other choice
is to comb back issues of C++ Report and C/C++ User's Journal for the relevent
information. (And know enough to ignore the articles that do it wrong.
Ok maybe wrong is too strong a word, but now that you have the option to
understand how the streams library is built you can use it the way it was
intended.)&nbsp;
<br>There is now no reason ANY programmer should create a new ostream class
by inheriting from basic_ostream&lt;>. The I/O streams library was designed
to be extended by programmers. Read this book and learn how to do it so
that you don't have to re-write every sub member as a forward to the actual
class.&nbsp;
<br>As for Locales, there is a chapter in the latest version of B.S's book
as an Appendix. Or about 1/4th of this book is devoted to how that mechanism
works.&nbsp;
<br>Buy it. You need it. Without it you are programming by guess and by
golly.&nbsp;</td>
