<p>Standard C++ provides a foundation for creating new, improved, and more
powerful C++ components. IOStreams and locales are two such major components
for text internationalization. As critical as these two APIs are, however,
there are few resources devoted to explaining them.
<p><b><i>Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales</i></b> fills this informational
gap. It provides a comprehensive description of, and reference to, the
iostreams and locales classes, showing how to put them to use and offering
advanced information on customizing and extending their basic operation.
Written by two experts involved with the development of the standard, this
book reveals the rationale behind the design of the APIs and points out
their potential pitfalls.
<p>This book serves as both a guide and a reference to C++ components.
Part I explains iostreams, what they are, how they are used, their underlying
architectural concepts, and the techniques for extending the iostream framework.
Part II introduces internationalization and shows you how to adapt your
program to local conventions. Readers seeking an initial overview of the
problem domain will find an explanation of what internationalization and
localization are, how they are related, and how they differ. With examples,
the authors show the differences among cultural conventions, how C++ locales
can be used to address such differences, and how locale framework can be
extended to handle further, nonstandard cultural conventions.

IOStreams and locales serve as a foundation library that provides a number
of ready-to-use interfaces, as well as frameworks that can be customized
and extended. The class reference to C++ IOStreams and locales completes
this comprehensive resource, which belongs in the libraries of all intermediate
and advanced C++ programmers.
