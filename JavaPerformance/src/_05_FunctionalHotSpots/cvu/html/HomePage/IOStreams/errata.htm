<p>Thanks to everybody who took the time to send us an email to draw our
attention to mistakes and typos in the book. We thank our readers for reading
the book so carefully and attentively that you could spot the flaws. Thanks
a lot!
<p>In addition, several readers came up with ideas and suggestions of their
own inspired by topics from the IOStreams book. We would like to share
their ideas with interested readers by publishing them "as is". Got to

for further reading.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The list of errata is split into two sections:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH="80%" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP><b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-seriff"><font size=-1><a href="errata1st.htm">1st
Printing</a></font></font></b></td>

<td>Errors found in the 1st printing.&nbsp;
<br>These errors are corrected in the 2nd printing.&nbsp; Be warned: this
list is long and download might take a while.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP><b><nobr><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-seriff"><font size=-1><a href="errata2nd.htm">2nd
Printing</a></font></font></nobr></b></td>

<td>All remaining errors.&nbsp;
<br>You'll find them in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd printing.&nbsp; These errors
might be corrected in a 4th printing, should there be one.</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>Before you look up any errata you might want to identify whether you
have a copy of the first or the second printing. You can distinguish between
both by means of the copyright page, which is the back of the cover page.
On the bottom of that page you find two lines that identify the printing.
