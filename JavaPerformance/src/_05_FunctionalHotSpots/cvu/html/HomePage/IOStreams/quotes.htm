<p>"This is <b>THE</b> book on streams. There is nothing whatsoever like
this on the market, and anyone who needs to I18n/Localization will eat
this up. I found these chapters readable and informative."
<br><i>-- Chuck Allison, Consulting Editor, C/C++ Users Journal</i>
<p>"The combination of usage guide and reference manual is good. This book
is particularly relevant for anyone who needs to internationalize their
programs input and output to exhibit reasonable and expected behavior,
language, monetary and numeric formatting and syntax. In today's global
economy, internationalized behavior is a highly desirable goal."
<br><i>-- Mary Dageforde, Dageforde Consulting</i>
<p>"Langer and Kreft have an international book that applies to the United
States and the rest of the world the way they address internationalization."

<p>"Most C++ programmers know little about iostreams and yet use them all
the time without understanding how much it costs them or what they should
watch out for. This book tackles the right level of detail."
