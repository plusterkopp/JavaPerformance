<p>The list below mentions a few sites related to C++ in general that I
personally visit from time to time.
<h2>
Directories</h2>
The best directory for C++ related resources is maintained by Bernd Mohr
at the research center in J&uuml;lich.&nbsp; There is hardly anything that
I could possibly add.
<blockquote><img SRC="../../Images/bar-small.gif" VSPACE=10 NOSAVE height=2 width=500>
<br><a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/cxx/"><img SRC="../../Images/logo-fzj-small.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=44 width=282></a>
<br>An impressive directory of C++ resources such as books, articles, FAQs,
other C++ pages, compilers, libraries, etc. is compiled and maintained
by Bernd Mohr at the <a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/cxx/">Research
Centre J&uuml;lich</a> , Germany. Whatever you need to know about C++,
you'll probably find a link to it in this directory.

<p><a href="http://www.accu.org/"><img SRC="../../Images/logo-accu-small.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=34 width=300></a>
<br>The <a href="http://www.accu.org/">ACCU</a> (Association of C &amp;
C++ Users) is a non-profit organisation devoted to professionalism at all
levels in C, C++ and Java. There is an excellent and comprehensive list
of <a href="http://www.accu.org/bookreviews/public/index.htm">book reviews</a>
available at their site. Also, see their calendar of <a href="http://www.accu.org/events/public/index.htm">events</a>
.

<h2>
Standardization</h2>

<blockquote><img SRC="../../Images/bar-small.gif" VSPACE=10 NOSAVE height=2 width=500>
<br><font size=+2>ISO/IEC</font>
<br>C++ has been standardized by ANSI (The American National Standards
Institute), BSI (The British Standards Institute), DIN (The German national
standards organization), several other national standards bodies, and ISO
(The International Standards Organization). You can find a slightly out-of-date
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/c++std/WP/CD2">draft
standard</a> here. The ISO standard has been finalized and adopted by unanimous
vote Nov 14, 1997. It was ratified in August 1998. The standard is ISO/IEC
14882; it is available for downloading at the National Committee for Information
Technology Standards Electronic Store. The cost is US$18.00 payable on-line
via credit card.
<p>The <a href="http://www.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21">ISO C++ standards committee</a>
maintains an official site with information about the current state of
the standards effort. Their webpage has information about the standardization
effort, among them a link to the <a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/open/n2356/">draft
version</a> of the current standard and a list of <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~ark/c++std/2002/pdf/revisions.pdf">corridenda</a>
(corrections/updates/clarifications) voted into the standard in 2002. ISO
is in the process of publishing the revised standard (with this corridenda
integrated), which will be known as ISO/IEC 14882:2002. It will be available
soon as a <a href="../Books/C++.htm#C++StandardWiley">book</a>: "The C++
Standard", published by Wiley, ISBN 0 470 84674-7.
<p>For further resources related to the language standard go to <a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/cxx/extmain.html#doc">J&uuml;lich
Research Center</a> or visit <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/C++.html">Bjarne
Stroustrup's homepage</a>.

<br>The <a href="http://www.artima.com/cppsource">C++ Source</a> is a peer-reviewed
source of articles for the C++ community.&nbsp; This online magazine was
initiated by a group of&nbsp; C++ luminaries in 2003/2004 and went online
in June 2004.&nbsp; It hosts articles, tutorials, news, and lots of stuff.&nbsp;
The distinguishing idea is that all submissions undergo a review by seasoned
C++ professionals to ensure that the publications are of high quality and
of interest.

C++ Libraries</h2>

<blockquote><img SRC="../../Images/bar-small.gif" VSPACE=10 NOSAVE height=2 width=500>
<br><a NAME="STL"></a>
<br><font size=+2>STL (Standard Template Library)</font>
<br>For links to resources related to the STL go to the <a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/cxx/extmain.html#stl">J&uuml;lich
Research Center</a>.&nbsp; It provides links to download sites, tutorial,
online references, and many more.
<p>In addition you might want to check out <a href="http://www.bdsoft.com/tools/stlfilt.html">STLFilt</a>,
which is an STL error message decryptor implemented by Leor Zolman; it
simplifies and/or reformats long-winded error and warning messages and
renders many of the cryptic diagnostics comprehensible.
