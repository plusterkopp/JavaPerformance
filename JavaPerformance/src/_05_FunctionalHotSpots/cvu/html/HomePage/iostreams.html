<p>This page provides information related to our book such as a list of
errata, reviews, comments, an excerpt, and other information that might
be helpful to our readers.
<p><b><font size=-1>LIST OF ERRATA</font></b>
<br>Many readers have been reading the book so carefully and attentively
that they spotted quite a number of typos, errors, inconsistencies, and
other flaws. For the complete list of errata either go to <b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-seriff"><font size=-2><a href="IOStreams/errata.htm">ERRATA</a></font></font></b>.
(Be warned: the errata list is long and download might take a while.)
<p><b><font size=-1>SAMPLE READING</font></b>
<br>If you look for a sample from the book, you might want to dig for for
the April 2000 issue of C++ Report. It contained an excerpt from the book.
The excerpt describes the mechanics of stream buffers, which are an important
extension point in the IOStreams framework. Due to space limitations in
the printed media the excerpt was shortened, but the complete chapter is
available at&nbsp; <b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-seriff"><font size=-2><a href="IOStreams/Excerpt/excerpt.htm#Top">EXCERPT</a></font></font></b>.
<p><b><font size=-1>CODE SAMPLES</font></b>
<br>A couple of readers expressed interest in the source code that is printed
in the book.&nbsp; Unfortunately we never found the time to it put anything
together. However, an enthusiastic reader, <a href="mailto:Klaus_Wittlich@sae.de">Klaus
Wittlich</a> of&nbsp;<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">SAE
IT-systems</span> in Cologne Germany, volunteered to implement all examples
from the book and made them work under Microsoft Visual C++.NET. The result
of his effort is available as a zip file (309 KB); for access to the source
code go to <b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-seriff"><font size=-2><a href="IOStreams/examples.htm">CODE</a></font></font></b>.
<p><b><font size=-1>SEMINAR</font></b>
<br>We received a request for a seminar on IOStreams and Locales and put
together a 5-day course based on the book. The added value of the seminar
is the opportunity to do hand-on labs and implement real-life solutions
using iostreams and locales. Plus, in a course you can ask all the questions
that the book left open. For information about the seminar go to to <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2><a href="Courses/IOStreamsInDepth.htm">SEMINAR</a></font></font></b>.
<p><b><font size=-1>PUBLISHER INFORMATION</font></b>
<br>The publisher <a href="http://www.aw.com/">Addison-Wesley</a> provides
information about our book on their web site at <a href="http://www.aw.com/cseng/titles/0-201-18395-1/">www.aw.com/cseng/titles/0-201-18395-1/</a>
. You'll find the table of contents, the preface, and other related information.
<p><b><font size=-1>TRANSLATIONS</font></b>
<br>The book has been translated to Chinese (ISBN 7-115-09052-1).
